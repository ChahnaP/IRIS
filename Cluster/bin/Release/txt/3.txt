Wikis can be community websites and <a href="/wiki/Intranet" title="Intranet">intranets</a>, for example. Some permit control over different functions (levels of access).

A single page in a wiki website is referred to as a "wiki page", while the entire collection of pages, which are usually well interconnected by <a href="/wiki/Hyperlink" title="Hyperlink">hyperlinks</a>, is "the wiki". A wiki is essentially a database for creating, browsing, and searching through information. A wiki allows for non-linear, evolving, complex and networked text, argument and interaction.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Legal_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-Legal-5"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>, <p>A defining characteristic of wiki technology is the ease with which pages can be created and updated. Generally, there is no review before modifications are accepted. Many wikis are open to alteration by the general public without requiring them to register <a href="/wiki/User_(computing)" title="User (computing)">user</a> accounts. Many edits can be made in real-time and appear almost instantly online. This can facilitate abuse of the system. Private wiki servers require <a href="/wiki/Authentication" title="Authentication">user authentication</a> to edit pages, and sometimes even to read them.</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Maged_N._Kamel_Boulos" title="Maged N. Kamel Boulos">Maged N. Kamel Boulos</a>, Cito Maramba and <a href="/wiki/Steve_Wheeler" title="Steve Wheeler">Steve Wheeler</a> write that it is the "openness of wikis that gives rise to the concept of 'Darwikinism', which is a concept that describes the '<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Socially_Darwinian" title="Socially Darwinian">socially Darwinian</a> process' that wiki pages are subject to. Basically, because of the openness of wikis and the rapidity with which wiki pages can be edited, the pages undergo a <a href="/wiki/Natural_selection" title="Natural selection">natural selection</a> process like that which nature subjects to living organisms. 'Unfit' sentences and sections are ruthlessly culled, edited and replaced if they are not considered 'fit', which hopefully results in the evolution of a higher quality and more relevant page. Whilst such openness may invite 'vandalism' and the posting of untrue information, this same openness also makes it possible to rapidly correct or restore a 'quality' wiki page."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-BMC_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-BMC-6"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>, <p>There are many different ways in which wikis have users edit the content. Ordinarily, the structure and formatting of wiki pages are specified with a simplified markup language, sometimes known as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wikitext" title="Wikitext">wikitext</a> (for example, starting a line of text with an <a href="/wiki/Asterisk" title="Asterisk">asterisk</a> often sets up a <a href="/wiki/Bullet_(typography)" title="Bullet (typography)">bulleted list</a>). The style and syntax of wikitexts can vary greatly among wiki implementations, some of which also allow <a href="/wiki/HTML" title="HTML">HTML</a> tags. Designers of wikis often take this approach because HTML, with its many cryptic tags, is not very legible, making it hard to edit. Wikis therefore favour plain-text editing, with fewer and simpler conventions than HTML, for indicating style and structure. Although limiting access to HTML and <a href="/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" title="Cascading Style Sheets">Cascading Style Sheets</a> (CSS) of wikis limits user ability to alter the structure and formatting of wiki content, there are some benefits. Limited access to CSS promotes consistency in the look and feel, and having <a href="/wiki/JavaScript" title="JavaScript">JavaScript</a> disabled prevents a user from implementing code that may limit access for other users.</p>, <p><tt>&lt;p&gt;"I've had &lt;b&gt;nothing&lt;/b&gt; yet," Alice replied in an offended tone, "so I can't take more."&lt;/p&gt;<br/>

"It's very easy to take <i>more</i> than nothing."</p>, <p>Increasingly, wikis are making <a href="/wiki/WYSIWYG" title="WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a> editing available to users, usually by means of <a href="/wiki/JavaScript" title="JavaScript">JavaScript</a> or an <a href="/wiki/ActiveX" title="ActiveX">ActiveX</a> control that translates graphically entered formatting instructions into the corresponding <a href="/wiki/HTML_element" title="HTML element">HTML tags</a> or wikitext. In those implementations, the markup of a newly edited, marked-up version of the page is generated and submitted to the server <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transparency_(human-computer_interaction)" title="Transparency (human-computer interaction)">transparently</a>, shielding the user from this technical detail. However, WYSIWYG controls do not always provide all of the features available in wikitext, and some users prefer not to use a WYSIWYG editor. Hence, many of these sites offer some means to edit the wikitext directly.</p>, <p>Most wikis keep a record of changes made to wiki pages; often, every version of the page is stored. This means that authors can revert to an older version of the page, should it be necessary because a mistake has been made or the page has been vandalized. Many implementations, like <a href="/wiki/MediaWiki" title="MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a>, allow users to supply an <i>edit summary</i> when they edit a page; this is a short piece of text summarising the changes. It is not inserted into the article, but is stored along with that revision of the page, allowing users to explain what has been done and why; this is similar to a log message when making changes to a <a href="/wiki/Revision_control" title="Revision control">revision-control</a> system.</p>, <p>Within the text of most pages there are usually a large number of <a href="/wiki/Hypertext" title="Hypertext">hypertext</a> links to other pages. This form of non-linear navigation is more "native" to wiki than structured/formalized navigation schemes. That said, users can also create any number of index or table-of-contents pages, with hierarchical categorization or whatever form of organization they like. These may be challenging to maintain by hand, as multiple authors create and delete pages in an ad hoc manner. Wikis generally provide one or more ways to categorize or tag pages to support the maintenance of such index pages.</p>, <p>Most wikis have a backlink feature, which displays all pages that link to a given page.</p>, <p>It is typical in a wiki to create links to pages that do not yet exist, as a way to invite others to share what they know about a subject new to the wiki.</p>, <p>Links are created using a specific syntax, the so-called "link pattern" (also see <a href="/wiki/CURIE" title="CURIE">CURIE</a>). Originally, most wikis used <a href="/wiki/CamelCase" title="CamelCase">CamelCase</a> to name pages and create links. These are produced by capitalizing words in a phrase and removing the spaces between them (the word "CamelCase" is itself an example). While CamelCase makes linking very easy, it also leads to links which are written in a form that deviates from the standard spelling. To link to a page with a single-word title, one must abnormally capitalize one of the letters in the word (e.g. "WiKi" instead of "Wiki"). CamelCase-based wikis are instantly recognizable because they have many links with names such as "TableOfContents" and "BeginnerQuestions." It is possible for a wiki to render the visible anchor for such links "pretty" by reinserting spaces, and possibly also reverting to lower case. However, this reprocessing of the link to improve the readability of the anchor is limited by the loss of capitalization information caused by CamelCase reversal. For example, "RichardWagner" should be rendered as "Richard Wagner," whereas "PopularMusic" should be rendered as "popular music". There is no easy way to determine which <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Capital_letter" title="Capital letter">capital letters</a> should remain capitalized. As a result, many wikis now have "free linking" using brackets, and some disable CamelCase by default.</p>, <p>Most wikis offer at least a title <a href="/wiki/Search_algorithm" title="Search algorithm">search</a>, and sometimes a <a href="/wiki/Full_text_search" title="Full text search">full-text search</a>. The scalability of the search depends on whether the wiki engine uses a database. Some wikis, such as <a href="/wiki/PmWiki" title="PmWiki">PmWiki</a>, use <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flat_file" title="Flat file">flat files</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Augar_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-Augar-7"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> MediaWiki's first versions used flat files, but it was rewritten by <a href="/wiki/Lee_Daniel_Crocker" title="Lee Daniel Crocker">Lee Daniel Crocker</a> in the early 2000s to be a database application. Indexed database access is necessary for high speed searches on large wikis. Alternatively, external <a href="/wiki/Web_search_engine" title="Web search engine">search engines</a> such as <a href="/wiki/Google_Search" title="Google Search">Google Search</a> can sometimes be used on wikis with limited searching functions in order to obtain more precise results. However, a search engine's indexes can be very out of date (days, weeks or months) for many websites.</p>, <p><a href="/wiki/WikiWikiWeb" title="WikiWikiWeb">WikiWikiWeb</a> was the first wiki.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-ebersbach10_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-ebersbach10-8"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> Ward Cunningham started developing WikiWikiWeb in Portland, Oregon, in 1994, and installed it on the <a href="/wiki/Domain_name" title="Domain name">Internet domain</a> <a class="external text" href="http://c2.com/" rel="nofollow">c2.com</a> on March 25, 1995.

Thus, while wikis are very open, they provide a means to verify the validity of recent additions to the body of pages. The most prominent, on almost every wiki, is the "Recent Changes" page—a specific list numbering recent edits, or a list of edits made within a given time frame.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> Some wikis can filter the list to remove minor edits and edits made by automatic importing scripts ("<a href="/wiki/Internet_bot" title="Internet bot">bots</a>").<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup></p>, <p>From the change log, other functions are accessible in most wikis: the <a href="/wiki/Changelog" title="Changelog">revision history</a> shows previous page versions and the <a href="/wiki/Diff" title="Diff">diff</a> feature highlights the changes between two revisions. Using the revision history, an editor can view and restore a previous version of the article. The diff feature can be used to decide whether or not this is necessary. A regular wiki user can view the diff of an edit listed on the "Recent Changes" page and, if it is an unacceptable edit, consult the history, restoring a previous revision; this process is more or less streamlined, depending on the wiki software used.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup></p>, <p>In case unacceptable edits are missed on the "recent changes" page, some wiki engines provide additional content control. It can be monitored to ensure that a page, or a set of pages, keeps its quality. A person willing to maintain pages will be warned of modifications to the pages, allowing him or her to verify the validity of new editions quickly.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> A watchlist is a common implementation of this.</p>, <p>Some wikis also implement "patrolled revisions," in which editors with the requisite credentials can mark some edits as not vandalism. A "flagged revisions" system can prevent edits from going live until they have been reviewed.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></p>, <p>Critics of publicly editable wiki systems argue that these systems could be easily tampered with, while proponents argue that the community of users can catch malicious content and correct it.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Britannica_1-2"><a href="#cite_note-Britannica-1"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> Lars Aronsson, a data systems specialist, summarizes the controversy as follows:</p>, <p>High editorial standards in medicine have led to the idea of expert-moderated wikis.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Some wikis allow one to link to specific versions of articles, which has been useful to the scientific community, in that expert peer reviewers could analyse articles, improve them and provide links to the trusted version of that article.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></p>, <p>Noveck points out that "participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation." On controversial topics that have been subject to disruptive editing, a wiki may restrict editing to registered users.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Noveck_20-0"><a href="#cite_note-Noveck-20"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup></p>, <p>The open philosophy of most wikis, allowing anyone to edit content, does not ensure that every editor is well-meaning. Virtual vandalism can be a major problem. In larger wiki sites, such as those run by the <a href="/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation" title="Wikimedia Foundation">Wikimedia Foundation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vandalism" title="Vandalism">vandalism</a> can go unnoticed for a period of time. Wikis, because of their open access, are susceptible to intentional disruption, known as "<a href="/wiki/Troll_(Internet)" title="Troll (Internet)">trolling</a>". Wikis tend to take a <i><a href="/wiki/Soft_security" title="Soft security">soft-security</a></i><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-soft_security_21-0"><a href="#cite_note-soft_security-21"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> approach to the problem of vandalism; making damage easy to undo rather than attempting to prevent damage. Larger wikis often employ sophisticated methods, such as bots that automatically identify and revert vandalism and JavaScript enhancements that show characters that have been added in each edit. In this way vandalism can be limited to just "minor vandalism" or "sneaky vandalism", where the characters added/eliminated are so few that bots do not identify them and users do not pay much attention to them.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from May 2012">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup></p>, <p>The amount of vandalism a wiki receives depends on how open the wiki is. For instance, some wikis allow unregistered users, identified by their <a href="/wiki/IP_address" title="IP address">IP addresses</a>, to edit content, whilst others limit this function to just registered users. Most wikis allow anonymous editing without an account,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> but give registered users additional editing functions; on most wikis, becoming a registered user is a short and simple process. Some wikis require an additional waiting period before gaining access to certain tools. For example, on the <a href="/wiki/English_Wikipedia" title="English Wikipedia">English Wikipedia</a>, registered users can rename pages only if their account is at least four days old. Other wikis such as the <a href="/wiki/Portuguese_Wikipedia" title="Portuguese Wikipedia">Portuguese Wikipedia</a> use an editing requirement instead of a time requirement, granting extra tools after the user has made a certain number of edits to prove their trustworthiness and usefulness as an editor. Basically, "closed up" wikis are more secure and reliable but grow slowly, whilst more open wikis grow at a steady rate but result in being an easy target for vandalism. A clear example of this would be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vandalism_of_Wikipedia" title="Vandalism of Wikipedia">that of Wikipedia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Citizendium" title="Citizendium">Citizendium</a>. The first is extremely open, allowing anyone with a computer and Internet access to edit it, making it grow rapidly, whilst the latter requires the users' real name and a biography of themselves, affecting the growth of the wiki but creating an almost "vandalism-free" ambiance.</p>, <p>Edit wars can also occur as users repetitively revert a page to the version they favor. Some wiki software allows an administrator to stop such edit wars by locking a page from further editing until a decision has been made on what version of the page would be most appropriate.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Legal_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-Legal-5"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></p>, <p>Some wikis are in a better position than others to control behavior due to governance structures existing outside the wiki. For instance, a college teacher can create incentives for students to behave themselves on a class wiki they administer, by limiting editing to logged-in users and pointing out that all contributions can be traced back to the contributors. Bad behavior can then be dealt with in accordance with university policies.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Augar_7-1"><a href="#cite_note-Augar-7"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>, <p><a href="/wiki/Malware" title="Malware">Malware</a> can also be problem, as users can add links to sites hosting malicious code. For example, a German Wikipedia article about the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Blaster_Worm" title="Blaster Worm">Blaster Worm</a> was edited to include a hyperlink to a malicious website. Users of vulnerable Microsoft Windows systems who followed the link would be infected.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Legal_5-2"><a href="#cite_note-Legal-5"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> A countermeasure is the use of software that prevents users from saving an edit that contains a link to a site listed on a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Blacklist" title="Blacklist">blacklist</a> of malware sites.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup></p>, <p>Many wiki <a href="/wiki/Online_community" title="Online community">communities</a> are private, particularly within <a href="/wiki/Enterprise_software" title="Enterprise software">enterprises</a>.

Wikipedia, for instance, has a labyrinthine set of policies and guidelines summed up in its five pillars: Wikipedia is an encyclopedia; Wikipedia has a neutral point of view; Wikipedia is free content; Wikipedians should interact in a respectful and civil manner; and Wikipedia does not have firm rules. Many wikis have adopted a set of commandments. For instance, <a href="/wiki/Conservapedia" title="Conservapedia">Conservapedia</a> commands, among other things, that its editors use "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Before_Christ" title="Before Christ">B.C.</a>" rather than "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/B.C.E." title="B.C.E.">B.C.E.</a>" when referring to years prior to the common era and refrain from "unproductive activity."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-41"><a href="#cite_note-41"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup> One teacher instituted a commandment for a class wiki, "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Golden_Rule" title="The Golden Rule">Wiki unto others as you would have them wiki unto you</a>."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Augar_7-2"><a href="#cite_note-Augar-7"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>, <p>Joint authorship of articles, in which different users participate in correcting, editing, and compiling the finished product, can also cause editors to become <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tenants_in_common" title="Tenants in common">tenants in common</a> of the copyright, making it impossible to republish without the permission of all co-owners, some of whose identities may be unknown due to pseudonymous or anonymous editing.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Legal_5-4"><a href="#cite_note-Legal-5"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> However, where persons contribute to a collective work such as an encyclopedia, there is no joint ownership if the contributions are separate and distinguishable.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-42"><a href="#cite_note-42"><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup> Despite most wikis' tracking of individual contributions, the action of contributing to a wiki page is still arguably one of jointly correcting, editing, or compiling which would give rise to joint ownership.</p>, <p>Some copyright issues can be alleviated through the use of an <a href="/wiki/Open_content" title="Open content">open content</a> license.

If a wiki owner displays indifference and forgoes controls (such as banning copyright infringers) that he could have exercised to stop copyright infringement, he may be deemed to have authorized infringement, especially if the wiki is primarily used to infringe copyrights or obtains direct financial benefit, such as advertising revenue, from infringing activities.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Legal_5-5"><a href="#cite_note-Legal-5"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> In the United States, wikis may benefit from Section 230 of the <a href="/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act" title="Communications Decency Act">Communications Decency Act</a>, which protects sites that engage in "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Good_Samaritan" title="Good Samaritan">Good Samaritan</a>" policing of harmful material, with no requirement on the quality or quantity of such self-policing.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-43"><a href="#cite_note-43"><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup> However, it has also been argued that a wiki's enforcement of certain rules, such as anti-bias, verifiability, reliable sourcing, and no-original-research policies, could pose legal risks.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-44"><a href="#cite_note-44"><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup> When <a href="/wiki/Defamation" title="Defamation">defamation</a> occurs on a wiki, theoretically all users of the wiki can be held liable, because any of them had the ability to remove or amend the defamatory material from the "publication."
