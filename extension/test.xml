				Of Adversity       by Francis Bacon          160         It was an high speech of Seneca  after the manner of the Stoics   that the good things  which belong to prosperity  are to be wished  but the good things  that belong to adversity  are to be admired  Bona rerum secundarum optabilia  adversarum mirabilia  Certainly if miracles be the command over nature  they appear most in adversity  It is yet a higher speech of his  than the other  much too high for a heathen   It is true greatness  to have in one the frailty of a man  and the security of a God  Vere magnum habere fragilitatem hominis  securitatem Dei  This would have done better in poesy  where transcendences are more allowed  And the poets indeed have been busy with it  for it is in effect the thing  which figured in that strange fiction of the ancient poets  which seemeth not to be without mystery  nay  and to have some approach to the state of a Christian  that Hercules  when he went to unbind Prometheus  by whom human nature is represented   sailed the length of the great ocean  in an earthen pot or pitcher  lively describing Christian resolution  that saileth in the frail bark of the flesh  through the waves of the world  But to speak in a mean  The virtue of prosperity  is temperance  the virtue of adversity  is fortitude  which in morals is the more heroical virtue  Prosperity is the blessing of the Old Testament  adversity is the blessing of the New  which carrieth the greater benediction  and the clearer revelation of God s favor  Yet even in the Old Testament  if you listen to David s harp  you shall hear as many hearse like airs as carols  and the pencil of the Holy Ghost hath labored more in describing the afflictions of Job  than the felicities of Solomon  Prosperity is not without many fears and distastes  and adversity is not without comforts and hopes  We see in needle works and embroideries  it is more pleasing to have a lively work  upon a sad and solemn ground  than to have a dark and melancholy work  upon a lightsome ground  judge therefore of the pleasure of the heart  by the pleasure of the eye  Certainly virtue is like precious odors  most fragrant when they are incensed  or crushed  for prosperity doth best discover vice  but adversity doth best discover virtue                                           160                return to francis bacon online      search        contact  morgan     at morgan westegg com        page last modified  thu jan 12 01 37 48 2006
