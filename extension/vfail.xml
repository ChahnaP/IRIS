Unity       by Francis Bacon          160         Religion being the chief band of human society  is a happy thing  when itself is well contained within the true band of unity  The quarrels  and divisions about religion  were evils unknown to the heathen  The reason was  because the religion of the heathen  consisted rather in rites and ceremonies  than in any constant belief  For you may imagine  what kind of faith theirs was  when the chief doctors  and fathers of their church  were the poets  But the true God hath this attribute  that he is a jealous God  and therefore  his worship and religion  will endure no mixture  nor partner  We shall therefore speak a few words  concerning the unity of the church  what are the fruits thereof  what the bounds  and what the means       The fruits of unity  next unto the well pleasing of God  which is all in all  are two  the one  towards those that are without the church  the other  towards those that are within  For the former  it is certain  that heresies  and schisms  are of all others the greatest scandals  yea  more than corruption of manners  For as in the natural body  a wound  or solution of continuity  is worse than a corrupt humor  so in the spiritual  So that nothing  doth so much keep men out of the church and drive men out of the church  as breach of unity  And therefore  whensoever it cometh to that pass  that one saith  Ecce in deserto  another saith  Ecce in penetralibus  that is  when some men seek Christ  in the conventicles of heretics  and others  in an outward face of a church  that voice had need continually to sound in men s ears  Nolite exire   Go not out  The doctor of the Gentiles  the propriety of whose vocation  drew him to have a special care of those without  saith  if an heathen come in  and hear you speak with several tongues  will he not say that you are mad  And certainly it is little better  when atheists  and profane persons  do hear of so many discordant  and contrary opinions in religion  it doth avert them from the church  and maketh them  to sit down in the chair of the scorners  It is but a light thing  to be vouched in so serious a matter  but yet it expresseth well the deformity  There is a master of scoffing  that in his catalogue of books of a feigned library  sets down this title of a book  The Morris Dance of Heretics  For indeed  every sect of them  hath a diverse posture  or cringe by themselves  which cannot but move derision in worldlings  and depraved politics  who are apt to contemn holy things       As for the fruit towards those that are within  it is peace  which containeth infinite blessings  It establisheth faith  it kindleth charity  the outward peace of the church  distilleth into peace of conscience  and it turneth the labors of writing  and reading of controversies  into treaties of mortification and devotion       Concerning the bounds of unity  the true placing of them  importeth exceedingly  There appear to be two extremes  For to certain zealants  all speech of pacification is odious  Is it peace  Jehu  What hast thou to do with peace  turn thee behind me  Peace is not the matter  but following  and party  Contrariwise  certain Laodiceans  and lukewarm persons  think they may accommodate points of religion  by middle way  and taking part of both  and witty reconcilements  as if they would make an arbitrament between God and man  Both these extremes are to be avoided  which will be done  if the league of Christians  penned by our Savior himself  were in two cross clauses thereof  soundly and plainly expounded  He that is not with us  is against us  and again  He that is not against us  is with us  that is  if the points fundamental and of substance in religion  were truly discerned and distinguished  from points not merely of faith  but of opinion  order  or good intention  This is a thing may seem to many a matter trivial  and done already  But if it were done less partially  it would be embraced more generally       Of this I may give only this advice  according to my small model  Men ought to take heed  of rending God s church  by two kinds of controversies  The one is  when the matter of the point controverted  is too small and light  not worth the heat and strife about it  kindled only by contradiction  For  as it is noted  by one of the fathers  Christ s coat indeed had no seam  but the church s vesture was of divers colors  whereupon he saith  In veste varietas sit  scissura non sit  they be two things  unity and uniformity  The other is  when the matter of the point controverted  is great  but it is driven to an over great subtilty  and obscurity  so that it becometh a thing rather ingenious  than substantial  A man that is of judgment and understanding  shall sometimes hear ignorant men differ  and know well within himself  that those which so differ  mean one thing  and yet they themselves would never agree  And if it come so to pass  in that distance of judgment  which is between man and man  shall we not think that God above  that knows the heart  doth not discern that frail men  in some of their contradictions  intend the same thing  and accepteth of both  The nature of such controversies is excellently expressed  by St  Paul  in the warning and precept  that he giveth concerning the same  Devita profanas vocum novitates  et oppositiones falsi nominis scientiae  Men create oppositions  which are not  and put them into new terms  so fixed  as whereas the meaning ought to govern the term  the term in effect governeth the meaning  There be also two false peaces  or unities  the one  when the peace is grounded  but upon an implicit ignorance  for all colors will agree in the dark  the other  when it is pieced up  upon a direct admission of contraries  in fundamental points  For truth and falsehood  in such things  are like the iron and clay  in the toes of Nebuchadnezzar s image  they may cleave  but they will not incorporate       Concerning the means of procuring unity  men must beware  that in the procuring  or muniting  of religious unity  they do not dissolve and deface the laws of charity  and of human society  There be two swords amongst Christians  the spiritual and temporal  and both have their due office and place  in the maintenance of religion  But we may not take up the third sword  which is Mahomet s sword  or like unto it  that is  to propagate religion by wars  or by sanguinary persecutions to force consciences  except it be in cases of overt scandal  blasphemy  or intermixture of practice against the state  much less to nourish seditions  to authorize conspiracies and rebellions  to put the sword into the people s hands  and the like  tending to the subversion of all government  which is the ordinance of God  For this is but to dash the first table against the second  and so to consider men as Christians  as we forget that they are men  Lucretius the poet  when he beheld the act of Agamemnon  that could endure the sacrificing of his own daughter  exclaimed  Tantum Religio potuit suadere malorum       What would he have said  if he had known of the massacre in France  or the powder treason of England  He would have been seven times more Epicure  and atheist  than he was  For as the temporal sword is to be drawn with great circumspection in cases of religion  so it is a thing monstrous  to put it into the hands of the common people  Let that be left unto the Anabaptists  and other furies  It was great blasphemy  when the devil said  I will ascend  and be like the highest  but it is greater blasphemy  to personate God  and bring him in saying  I will descend  and be like the prince of darkness  and what is it better  to make the cause of religion to descend  to the cruel and execrable actions of murthering princes  butchery of people  and subversion of states and governments  Surely this is to bring down the Holy Ghost  instead of the likeness of a dove  in the shape of a vulture or raven  and set  out of the bark of a Christian church  a flag of a bark of pirates  and assassins  Therefore it is most necessary  that the church  by doctrine and decree  princes by their sword  and all learnings  both Christian and moral  as by their Mercury rod  do damn and send to hell for ever  those facts and opinions tending to the support of the same  as hath been already in good part done  Surely in counsels concerning religion  that counsel of the apostle would be prefixed  Ira hominis non implet justitiam Dei  And it was a notable observation of a wise father  and no less ingenuously confessed  that those which held and persuaded pressure of consciences  were commonly interested therein  themselves  for their own ends

law to weed it out  For as for the first wrong  it doth but offend the law  but the revenge of that wrong  putteth the law out of office  Certainly  in taking revenge  a man is but even with his enemy  but in passing it over  he is superior  for it is a prince s part to pardon  And Solomon  I am sure  saith  It is the glory of a man  to pass by an offence  That which is past is gone  and irrevocable  and wise men have enough to do  with things present and to come  therefore they do but trifle with themselves  that labor in past matters  There is no man doth a wrong  for the wrong s sake  but thereby to purchase himself profit  or pleasure  or honor  or the like  Therefore why should I be angry with a man  for loving himself better than me  And if any man should do wrong  merely out of ill nature  why  yet it is but like the thorn or briar  which prick and scratch  because they can do no other  The most tolerable sort of revenge  is for those wrongs which there is no law to remedy  but then let a man take heed  the revenge be such as there is no law to punish  else a man s enemy is still before hand  and it is two for one  Some  when they take revenge  are desirous  the party should know  whence it cometh  This is the more generous  For the delight seemeth to be  not so much in doing the hurt  as in making the party repent  But base and crafty cowards  are like the arrow that flieth in the dark  Cosmus  duke of Florence  had a desperate saying against perfidious or neglecting friends  as if those wrongs were unpardonable  You shall read  saith he  that we are commanded to forgive our enemies  but you never read  that we are commanded to forgive our friends  But yet the spirit of Job was in a better tune  Shall we  saith he  take good at God s hands  and not be content to take evil also  And so of friends in a proportion  This is certain  that a man that studieth revenge  keeps his own wounds green  which otherwise would heal  and do well  Public revenges are for the most part fortunate  as that for the death of Caesar  for the death of Pertinax  for the death of Henry the Third of France  and many more  But in private revenges  it is not so  Nay rather  vindictive persons live the life of witches  who  as they are mischievous  so end they infortunate                                           160                return to francis bacon

Bacon          160         It was an high speech of Seneca  after the manner of the Stoics   that the good things  which belong to prosperity  are to be wished  but the good things  that belong to adversity  are to be admired  Bona rerum secundarum optabilia  adversarum mirabilia  Certainly if miracles be the command over nature  they appear most in adversity  It is yet a higher speech of his  than the other  much too high for a heathen   It is true greatness  to have in one the frailty of a man  and the security of a God  Vere magnum habere fragilitatem hominis  securitatem Dei  This would have done better in poesy  where transcendences are more allowed  And the poets indeed have been busy with it  for it is in effect the thing  which figured in that strange fiction of the ancient poets  which seemeth not to be without mystery  nay  and to have some approach to the state of a Christian  that Hercules  when he went to unbind Prometheus  by whom human nature is represented   sailed the length of the great ocean  in an earthen pot or pitcher  lively describing Christian resolution  that saileth in the frail bark of the flesh  through the waves of the world  But to speak in a mean  The virtue of prosperity  is temperance  the virtue of adversity  is fortitude  which in morals is the more heroical virtue  Prosperity is the blessing of the Old Testament  adversity is the blessing of the New  which carrieth the greater benediction  and the clearer revelation of God s favor  Yet even in the Old Testament  if you listen to David s harp  you shall hear as many hearse like airs as carols  and the pencil of the Holy Ghost hath labored more in describing the afflictions of Job  than the felicities of Solomon  Prosperity is not without many fears and distastes  and adversity is not without comforts and hopes  We see in needle works and embroideries  it is more pleasing to have a lively work  upon a sad and solemn ground  than to have a dark and melancholy work  upon a lightsome ground  judge therefore of the pleasure of the heart  by the pleasure of the eye  Certainly virtue is like precious odors  most fragrant when they are incensed  or crushed  for prosperity doth best discover vice  but adversity doth best discover virtue                                           160                return to francis bacon online      search        contact  morgan     at

Dissimulation is but a faint kind of policy  or wisdom  for it asketh a strong wit  and a strong heart  to know when to tell truth  and to do it  Therefore it is the weaker sort of politics  that are the great dissemblers       Tacitus saith  Livia sorted well with the arts of her husband  and dissimulation of her son  attributing arts or policy to Augustus  and dissimulation to Tiberius  And again  when Mucianus encourageth Vespasian  to take arms against Vitellius  he saith  We rise not against the piercing judgment of Augustus  nor the extreme caution or closeness of Tiberius  These properties  of arts or policy  and dissimulation or closeness  are indeed habits and faculties several  and to be distinguished  For if a man have that penetration of judgment  as he can discern what things are to be laid open  and what to be secreted  and what to be showed at half lights  and to whom and when  which indeed are arts of state  and arts of life  as Tacitus well calleth them   to him  a habit of dissimulation is a hinderance and a poorness  But if a man cannot obtain to that judgment  then it is left to him generally  to be close  and a dissembler  For where a man cannot choose  or vary in particulars  there it is good to take the safest  and wariest way  in general  like the going softly  by one that cannot well see  Certainly the ablest men that ever were  have had all an openness  and frankness  of dealing  and a name of certainty and veracity  but then they were like horses well managed  for they could tell passing well  when to stop or turn  and at such times  when they thought the case indeed required dissimulation  if then they used it  it came to pass that the former opinion  spread abroad  of their good faith and clearness of dealing  made them almost invisible       There be three degrees of this hiding and veiling of a man s self  The first  closeness  reservation  and secrecy  when a man leaveth himself without observation  or without hold to be taken  what he is  The second  dissimulation  in the negative  when a man lets fall signs and arguments  that he is not  that he is  And the third  simulation  in the affirmative  when a man industriously and expressly feigns and pretends to be  that he is not       For the first of these  secrecy  it is indeed the virtue of a confessor  And assuredly  the secret man heareth many confessions  For who will open himself  to a blab or a babbler  But if a man be thought secret  it inviteth discovery  as the more close air sucketh in the more open  and as in confession  the revealing is not for worldly use  but for the ease of a man s heart  so secret men come to the knowledge of many things in that kind  while men rather discharge their minds  than impart their minds  In few words  mysteries are due to secrecy  Besides  to say truth  nakedness is uncomely  as well in mind as body  and it addeth no small reverence  to men s manners and actions  if they be not altogether open  As for talkers and futile persons  they are commonly vain and credulous withal  For he that talketh what he knoweth  will also talk what he knoweth not  Therefore set it down  that an habit of secrecy  is both politic and moral  And in this part  it is good that a man s face give his tongue leave to speak  For the discovery of a man s self  by the tracts of his countenance  is a great weakness and betraying  by how much it is many times more marked  and believed  than a man s words       For the second  which is dissimulation  it followeth many times upon secrecy  by a necessity  so that he that will be secret  must be a dissembler in some degree  For men are too cunning  to suffer a man to keep an indifferent carriage between both  and to be secret  without swaying the balance on either side  They will so beset a man with questions  and draw him on  and pick it out of him  that  without an absurd silence  he must show an inclination one way  or if he do not  they will gather as much by his silence  as by his speech  As for equivocations  or oraculous speeches  they cannot hold out long  So that no man can be secret  except he give himself a little scope of dissimulation  which is  as it were  but the skirts or train of secrecy       But for the third degree  which is simulation  and false profession  that I hold more culpable  and less politic  except it be in great and rare matters  And therefore a general custom of simulation  which is this last degree  is a vice  rising either of a natural falseness or fearfulness  or of a mind that hath some main faults  which because a man must needs disguise  it maketh him practise simulation in other things  lest his hand should be out of use       The great advantages of simulation and dissimulation are three  First  to lay asleep opposition  and to surprise  For where a man s intentions are published  it is an alarum  to call up all that are against them  The second is  to reserve to a man s self a fair retreat  For if a man engage himself by a manifest declaration  he must go through or take a fall  The third is  the better to discover the mind of another  For to him that opens himself  men will hardly show themselves adverse  but will fair let him go on  and turn their freedom of speech  to freedom of thought  And therefore it is a good shrewd proverb of the Spaniard  Tell a lie and find a troth  As if there were no way of discovery  but by simulation  There be also three disadvantages  to set it even  The first  that simulation and dissimulation commonly carry with them a show of fearfulness  which in any business  doth spoil the feathers  of round flying up to the mark  The second  that it puzzleth and perplexeth the conceits of many  that perhaps would otherwise co operate with him  and makes a man walk almost alone  to his own ends  The third and greatest is  that it depriveth a man of one of the most principal instruments for action  which is trust and belief  The best composition and temperature  is to have openness in fame and opinion  secrecy in habit  dissimulation in seasonable use  and a power to feign  if there be no remedy

cannot utter the one  nor they will not utter the other  Children sweeten labors  but they make misfortunes more bitter  They increase the cares of life  but they mitigate the remembrance of death  The perpetuity by generation is common to beasts  but memory  merit  and noble works  are proper to men  And surely a man shall see the noblest works and foundations have proceeded from childless men  which have sought to express the images of their minds  where those of their bodies have failed  So the care of posterity is most in them  that have no posterity  They that are the first raisers of their houses  are most indulgent towards their children  beholding them as the continuance  not only of their kind  but of their work  and so both children and creatures       The difference in affection  of parents towards their several children  is many times unequal  and sometimes unworthy  especially in the mothers  as Solomon saith  A wise son rejoiceth the father  but an ungracious son shames the mother  A man shall see  where there is a house full of children  one or two of the eldest respected  and the youngest made wantons  but in the midst  some that are as it were forgotten  who many times  nevertheless  prove the best  The illiberality of parents  in allowance towards their children  is an harmful error  makes them base  acquaints them with shifts  makes them sort with mean company  and makes them surfeit more when they come to plenty  And therefore the proof is best  when men keep their authority towards the children  but not their purse  Men have a foolish manner  both parents and schoolmasters and servants  in creating and breeding an emulation between brothers  during childhood  which many times sorteth to discord when they are men  and disturbeth families  The Italians make little difference between children  and nephews or near kinsfolks  but so they be of the lump  they care not though they pass not through their own body  And  to say truth  in nature it is much a like matter  insomuch that we see a nephew sometimes resembleth an uncle  or a kinsman  more than his own parent  as the blood happens  Let parents choose betimes  the vocations and courses they mean their children should take  for then they are most flexible  and let them not too much apply themselves to the disposition of their children  as thinking they will take best to that  which they have most mind to  It is true  that if the affection or aptness of the children be extraordinary  then it is good not to cross it  but generally the precept is good  optimum elige  suave et facile illud faciet consuetudo  Younger brothers are commonly fortunate  but seldom or never where the elder are disinherited                                           160                return to

Single Life       by Francis Bacon          160         He that hath wife and children hath given hostages to fortune  for they are impediments to great enterprises  either of virtue or mischief  Certainly the best works  and of greatest merit for the public  have proceeded from the unmarried or childless men  which both in affection and means  have married and endowed the public  Yet it were great reason that those that have children  should have greatest care of future times  unto which they know they must transmit their dearest pledges  Some there are  who though they lead a single life  yet their thoughts do end with themselves  and account future times impertinences  Nay  there are some other  that account wife and children  but as bills of charges  Nay more  there are some foolish rich covetous men that take a pride  in having no children  because they may be thought so much the richer  For perhaps they have heard some talk  Such an one is a great rich man  and another except to it  Yea  but he hath a great charge of children  as if it were an abatement to his riches  But the most ordinary cause of a single life  is liberty  especially in certain self pleasing and humorous minds  which are so sensible of every restraint  as they will go near to think their girdles and garters  to be bonds and shackles  Unmarried men are best friends  best masters  best servants  but not always best subjects  for they are light to run away  and almost all fugitives  are of that condition  A single life doth well with churchmen  for charity will hardly water the ground  where it must first fill a pool  It is indifferent for judges and magistrates  for if they be facile and corrupt  you shall have a servant  five times worse than a wife  For soldiers  I find the generals commonly in their hortatives  put men in mind of their wives and children  and I think the despising of marriage amongst the Turks  maketh the vulgar soldier more base  Certainly wife and children are a kind of discipline of humanity  and single men  though they may be many times more charitable  because their means are less exhaust  yet  on the other side  they are more cruel and hardhearted  good to make severe inquisitors   because their tenderness is not so oft called upon  Grave natures  led by custom  and therefore constant  are commonly loving husbands  as was said of Ulysses  vetulam suam praetulit immortalitati  Chaste women are often proud and froward  as presuming upon the merit of their chastity  It is one of the best bonds  both of chastity and obedience  in the wife  if she think her husband wise  which she will never do  if she find him jealous  Wives are young men s mistresses  companions for middle age  and old men s nurses  So as a man may have a quarrel to marry  when he will  But yet he was reputed one of the wise men  that made answer to the question  when a man should marry   A young man not yet  an elder man not at all  It is often seen that bad husbands  have very good wives  whether it be  that it raiseth the price of their husband s kindness  when it comes  or that the wives take a pride in their patience  But this never fails  if the bad husbands were of their own choosing  against their friends  consent  for then they will be sure to make good their own folly                                           160                return to francis bacon

         160          There be none of the affections  which have been noted to fascinate or bewitch  but love and envy  They both have vehement wishes  they frame themselves readily into imaginations and suggestions  and they come easily into the eye  especially upon the present of the objects  which are the points that conduce to fascination  if any such thing there be  see likewise  the Scripture calleth envy an evil eye  and the astrologers  call the evil influences of the stars  evil aspects  so that still there seemeth to be acknowledged  in the act of envy  an ejaculation or irradiation of the eye  Nay  some have been so curious  as to note  that the times when the stroke or percussion of an envious eye doth most hurt  are when the party envied is beheld in glory or triumph  for that sets an edge upon envy  and besides  at such times the spirits of the person envied  do come forth most into the outward parts  and so meet the blow       But leaving these curiosities  though not unworthy to be thought on  in fit place   we will handle  what persons are apt to envy others  what persons are most subject to be envied themselves  and what is the difference between public and private envy       A man that hath no virtue in himself  ever envieth virtue in others  For men s minds  will either feed upon their own good  or upon others  evil  and who wanteth the one  will prey upon the other  and whoso is out of hope  to attain to another s virtue  will seek to come at even hand  by depressing another s fortune       A man that is busy  and inquisitive  is commonly envious  For to know much of other men s matters  cannot be because all that ado may concern his own estate  therefore it must needs be  that he taketh a kind of play pleasure  in looking upon the fortunes of others  Neither can he  that mindeth but his own business  find much matter for envy  For envy is a gadding passion  and walketh the streets  and doth not keep home  Non est curiosus  quin idem sit malevolus       Men of noble birth  are noted to be envious towards new men  when they rise  For the distance is altered  and it is like a deceit of the eye  that when others come on  they think themselves  go back       Deformed persons  and eunuchs  and old men  and bastards  are envious  For he that cannot possibly mend his own case  will do what he can  to impair another s  except these defects light upon a very brave  and heroical nature  which thinketh to make his natural wants part of his honor  in that it should be said  that an eunuch  or a lame man  did such great matters  affecting the honor of a miracle  as it was in Narses the eunuch  and Agesilaus and Tamberlanes  that were lame men       The same is the case of men  that rise after calamities and misfortunes  For they are as men fallen out with the times  and think other men s harms  a redemption of their own sufferings       They that desire to excel in too many matters  out of levity and vain glory  are ever envious  For they cannot want work  it being impossible  but many  in some one of those things  should surpass them  Which was the character of Adrian the Emperor  that mortally envied poets  and painters  and artificers  in works wherein he had a vein to excel       Lastly  near kinsfolks  and fellows in office  and those that have been bred together  are more apt to envy their equals  when they are raised  For it doth upbraid unto them their own fortunes  and pointeth at them  and cometh oftener into their remembrance  and incurreth likewise more into the note of others  and envy ever redoubleth from speech and fame  Cain s envy was the more vile and malignant  towards his brother Abel  because when his sacrifice was better accepted  there was no body to look on  Thus much for those  that are apt to envy       Concerning those that are more or less subject to envy  First  persons of eminent virtue  when they are advanced  are less envied  For their fortune seemeth  but due unto them  and no man envieth the payment of a debt  but rewards and liberality rather  Again  envy is ever joined with the comparing of a man s self  and where there is no comparison  no envy  and therefore kings are not envied  but by kings  Nevertheless it is to be noted  that unworthy persons are most envied  at their first coming in  and afterwards overcome it better  whereas contrariwise  persons of worth and merit are most envied  when their fortune continueth long  For by that time  though their virtue be the same  yet it hath not the same lustre  for fresh men grow up that darken it       Persons of noble blood  are less envied in their rising  For it seemeth but right done to their birth  Besides  there seemeth not much added to their fortune  and envy is as the sunbeams  that beat hotter upon a bank  or steep rising ground  than upon a flat  And for the same reason  those that are advanced by degrees  are less envied than those that are advanced suddenly and per saltum       Those that have joined with their honor great travels  cares  or perils  are less subject to envy  For men think that they earn their honors hardly  and pity them sometimes  and pity ever healeth envy  Wherefore you shall observe  that the more deep and sober sort of politic persons  in their greatness  are ever bemoaning themselves  what a life they lead  chanting a quanta patimur  Not that they feel it so  but only to abate the edge of envy  But this is to be understood  of business that is laid upon men  and not such  as they call unto themselves  For nothing increaseth envy more  than an unnecessary and ambitious engrossing of business  And nothing doth extinguish envy than for a great person to preserve all other inferior officers  in their full rights and pre eminences of their places  For by that means  there be so many screens between him and envy       Above all  those are most subject to envy  which carry the greatness of their fortunes  in an insolent and proud manner  being never well  but while they are showing how great they are  either by outward pomp  or by triumphing over all opposition or competition  whereas wise men will rather do sacrifice to envy  in suffering themselves sometimes of purpose to be crossed  and overborne in things that do not much concern them  Notwithstanding  so much is true  that the carriage of greatness  in a plain and open manner  so it be without arrogancy and vain glory  doth draw less envy  than if it be in a more crafty and cunning fashion  For in that course  a man doth but disavow fortune  and seemeth to be conscious of his own want in worth  and doth but teach others  to envy him       Lastly  to conclude this part  as we said in the beginning  that the act of envy had somewhat in it of witchcraft  so there is no other cure of envy  but the cure of witchcraft  and that is to remove the lot  as they call it  and to lay it upon another  For which purpose  the wiser sort of great persons  bring in ever upon the stage somebody upon whom to derive the envy  that would come upon themselves  sometimes upon ministers and servants  sometimes upon colleagues and associates  and the like  and for that turn there are never wanting  some persons of violent and undertaking natures  who  so they may have power and business  will take it at any cost       Now  to speak of public envy  There is yet some good in public envy  whereas in private  there is none  For public envy  is as an ostracism  that eclipseth men  when they grow too great  And therefore it is a bridle also to great ones  to keep them within bounds       This envy  being in the Latin word invidia  goeth in the modern language  by the name of discontentment  of which we shall speak  in handling sedition  It is a disease  in a state  like to infection  For as infection spreadeth upon that which is sound  and tainteth it  so when envy is gotten once into a state  it traduceth even the best actions thereof  and turneth them into an ill odor  And therefore there is little won  by intermingling of plausible actions  For that doth argue but a weakness  and fear of envy  which hurteth so much the more  as it is likewise usual in infections  which if you fear them  you call them upon you       This public envy  seemeth to beat chiefly upon principal officers or ministers  rather than upon kings  and estates themselves  But this is a sure rule  that if the envy upon the minister be great  when the cause of it in him is small  or if the envy be general  in a manner upon all the ministers of an estate  then the envy  though hidden  is truly upon the state itself  And so much of public envy or discontentment  and the difference thereof from private envy  which was handled in the first place       We will add this in general  touching the affection of envy  that of all other affections  it is the most importune and continual  For of other affections  there is occasion given  but now and then  and therefore it was well said  Invidia festos dies non agit  for it is ever working upon some or other  And it is also noted  that love and envy do make a man pine  which other affections do not  because they are not so continual  It is also the vilest affection  and the most depraved  for which cause it is the proper attribute of the devil  who is called  the envious man  that soweth tares amongst the wheat by night  as it always cometh to pass  that envy worketh subtilly  and in the dark  and to the prejudice of good things  such as is the wheat                                           160

matter of comedies  and now and then of tragedies  but in life it doth much mischief  sometimes like a siren  sometimes like a fury  You may observe  that amongst all the great and worthy persons  whereof the memory remaineth  either ancient or recent  there is not one  that hath been transported to the mad degree of love  which shows that great spirits  and great business  do keep out this weak passion  You must except  nevertheless  Marcus Antonius  the half partner of the empire of Rome  and Appius Claudius  the decemvir and lawgiver  whereof the former was indeed a voluptuous man  and inordinate  but the latter was an austere and wise man  and therefore it seems  though rarely  that love can find entrance  not only into an open heart  but also into a heart well fortified  if watch be not well kept  It is a poor saying of Epicurus  Satis magnum alter alteri theatrum sumus  as if man  made for the contemplation of heaven  and all noble objects  should do nothing but kneel before a little idol and make himself a subject  though not of the mouth  as beasts are   yet of the eye  which was given him for higher purposes  It is a strange thing  to note the excess of this passion  and how it braves the nature  and value of things  by this  that the speaking in a perpetual hyperbole  is comely in nothing but in love  Neither is it merely in the phrase  for whereas it hath been well said  that the arch flatterer  with whom all the petty flatterers have intelligence  is a man s self  certainly the lover is more  For there was never proud man thought so absurdly well of himself  as the lover doth of the person loved  and therefore it was well said  That it is impossible to love  and to be wise  Neither doth this weakness appear to others only  and not to the party loved  but to the loved most of all  except the love be reciproque  For it is a true rule  that love is ever rewarded  either with the reciproque  or with an inward and secret contempt  By how much the more  men ought to beware of this passion  which loseth not only other things  but itself  As for the other losses  the poet s relation doth well figure them  that he that preferred Helena  quitted the gifts of Juno and Pallas  For whosoever esteemeth too much of amorous affection  quitteth both riches and wisdom  This passion hath his floods  in very times of weakness  which are great prosperity  and great adversity  though this latter hath been less observed  both which times kindle love  and make it more fervent  and therefore show it to be the child of folly  They do best  who if they cannot but admit love  yet make it keep quarters  and sever it wholly from their serious affairs  and actions  of life  for if it check once with business  it troubleth men s fortunes  and maketh men  that they can no ways be true to their own ends  I know not how  but martial men are given to love  I think  it is but as they are given to wine  for perils commonly ask to be paid in pleasures  There is in man s nature  a secret inclination and motion  towards love of others  which if it be not spent upon some one or a few  doth naturally spread itself towards many  and maketh men become humane and charitable  as it is seen sometime in friars  Nuptial love maketh mankind  friendly love perfecteth it  but wanton love corrupteth  and embaseth it

of fame  and servants of business  So as they have no freedom  neither in their persons  nor in their actions  nor in their times  It is a strange desire  to seek power and to lose liberty  or to seek power over others  and to lose power over a man s self  The rising unto place is laborious  and by pains  men come to greater pains  and it is sometimes base  and by indignities  men come to dignities  The standing is slippery  and the regress is either a downfall  or at least an eclipse  which is a melancholy thing  Cum non sis qui fueris  non esse cur velis vivere  Nay  retire men cannot when they would  neither will they  when it were reason  but are impatient of privateness  even in age and sickness  which require the shadow  like old townsmen  that will be still sitting at their street door  though thereby they offer age to scorn  Certainly great persons had need to borrow other men s opinions  to think themselves happy  for if they judge by their own feeling  they cannot find it  but if they think with themselves  what other men think of them  and that other men would fain be  as they are  then they are happy  as it were  by report  when perhaps they find the contrary within  For they are the first  that find their own griefs  though they be the last  that find their own faults  Certainly men in great fortunes are strangers to themselves  and while they are in the puzzle of business  they have no time to tend their health  either of body or mind  Illi mors gravis incubat  qui notus nimis omnibus  ignotus moritur sibi  In place  there is license to do good  and evil  whereof the latter is a curse  for in evil the best condition is not to will  the second  not to can  But power to do good  is the true and lawful end of aspiring  For good thoughts  though God accept them  yet  towards men  are little better than good dreams  except they be put in act  and that cannot be  without power and place  as the vantage  and commanding ground  Merit and good works  is the end of man s motion  and conscience of the same is the accomplishment of man s rest  For if a man can be partaker of God s theatre  he shall likewise be partaker of God s rest  Et conversus Deus  ut aspiceret opera quae fecerunt manus suae  vidit quod omnia essent bona nimis  and then the sabbath  In the discharge of thy place  set before thee the best examples  for imitation is a globe of precepts  And after a time  set before thee thine own example  and examine thyself strictly  whether thou didst not best at first  Neglect not also the examples  of those that have carried themselves ill  in the same place  not to set off thyself  by taxing their memory  but to direct thyself  what to avoid  Reform therefore  without bravery  or scandal of former times and persons  but yet set it down to thyself  as well to create good precedents  as to follow them  Reduce things to the first institution  and observe wherein  and how  they have degenerate  but yet ask counsel of both times  of the ancient time  what is best  and of the latter time  what is fittest  Seek to make thy course regular  that men may know beforehand  what they may expect  but be not too positive and peremptory  and express thyself well  when thou digressest from thy rule  Preserve the right of thy place  but stir not questions of jurisdiction  and rather assume thy right  in silence and de facto  than voice it with claims  and challenges  Preserve likewise the rights of inferior places  and think it more honor  to direct in chief  than to be busy in all  Embrace and invite helps  and advices  touching the execution of thy place  and do not drive away such  as bring thee information  as meddlers  but accept of them in good part  The vices of authority are chiefly four  delays  corruption  roughness  and facility  For delays  give easy access  keep times appointed  go through with that which is in hand  and interlace not business  but of necessity  For corruption  do not only bind thine own hands  or  thy servants  hands  from taking  but bind the hands of suitors also  from offering  For integrity used doth the one  but integrity professed  and with a manifest detestation of bribery  doth the other  And avoid not only the fault  but the suspicion  Whosoever is found variable  and changeth manifestly without manifest cause  giveth suspicion of corruption  Therefore always  when thou changest thine opinion or course  profess it plainly  and declare it  together with the reasons that move thee to change  and do not think to steal it  A servant or a favorite  if he be inward  and no other apparent cause of esteem  is commonly thought  but a by way to close corruption  For roughness  it is a needless cause of discontent  severity breedeth fear  but roughness breedeth hate  Even reproofs from authority  ought to be grave  and not taunting  As for facility  it is worse than bribery  For bribes come but now and then  but if importunity  or idle respects  lead a man  he shall never be without  As Solomon saith  To respect persons is not good  for such a man will transgress for a piece of bread  It is most true  that was anciently spoken  A place showeth the man  And it showeth some to the better  and some to the worse  Omnium consensu capax imperii  nisi imperasset  saith Tacitus of Galba  but of Vespasian he saith  Solus imperantium  Vespasianus mutatus in melius  though the one was meant of sufficiency  the other of manners  and affection  It is an assured sign of a worthy and generous spirit  whom honor amends  For honor is  or should be  the place of virtue and as in nature  things move violently to their place  and calmly in their place  so virtue in ambition is violent  in authority settled and calm  All rising to great place is by a winding star  and if there be factions  it is good to side a man s self  whilst he is in the rising  and to balance himself when he is placed  Use the memory of thy predecessor  fairly and tenderly  for if thou dost not  it is a debt will sure be paid when thou art gone  If thou have colleagues  respect them  and rather call them  when they look not for it  than exclude them  when they have reason to look to be called  Be not too sensible  or too remembering  of thy place in conversation  and private answers to suitors  but let it rather be said  When he sits in place  he is another man

was asked of Demosthenes  what was the chief part of an orator  he answered  action  what next  action  what next again  action  He said it  that knew it best  and had  by nature  himself no advantage in that he commended  A strange thing  that that of an orator  which is but superficial and rather the virtue of a player  should be placed so high  above those other noble parts  of invention  elocution  and the rest  nay  almost alone  as if it were all in all  But the reason is plain  There is in human nature generally  more of the fool than of the wise  and therefore those faculties  by which the foolish part of men s minds is taken  are most potent  Wonderful like is the case of boldness in civil business  what first  boldness  what second and third  boldness  And yet boldness is a child of ignorance and baseness  far inferior to other parts  But nevertheless it doth fascinate  and bind hand and foot  those that are either shallow in judgment  or weak in courage  which are the greatest part  yea and prevaileth with wise men at weak times  Therefore we see it hath done wonders  in popular states  but with senates  and princes less  and more ever upon the first entrance of bold persons into action  than soon after  for boldness is an ill keeper of promise  Surely  as there are mountebanks for the natural body  so are there mountebanks for the politic body  men that undertake great cures  and perhaps have been lucky  in two or three experiments  but want the grounds of science  and therefore cannot hold out  Nay  you shall see a bold fellow many times do Mahomet s miracle  Mahomet made the people believe that he would call an hill to him  and from the top of it offer up his prayers  for the observers of his law  The people assembled  Mahomet called the hill to come to him  again and again  and when the hill stood still  he was never a whit abashed  but said  If the hill will not come to Mahomet  Mahomet  will go to the hill  So these men  when they have promised great matters  and failed most shamefully  yet  if they have the perfection of boldness  they will but slight it over  and make a turn  and no more ado  Certainly to men of great judgment  bold persons are a sport to behold  nay  and to the vulgar also  boldness has somewhat of the ridiculous  For if absurdity be the subject of laughter  doubt you not but great boldness is seldom without some absurdity  Especially it is a sport to see  when a bold fellow is out of countenance  for that puts his face into a most shrunken  and wooden posture  as needs it must  for in bashfulness  the spirits do a little go and come  but with bold men  upon like occasion  they stand at a stay  like a stale at chess  where it is no mate  but yet the game cannot stir  But this last were fitter for a satire than for a serious observation  This is well to be weighed  that boldness is ever blind  for it seeth not danger  and inconveniences  Therefore it is ill in counsel  good in execution  so that the right use of bold persons is  that they never command in chief  but be seconds  and under the direction of others  For in counsel  it is good to see dangers  and in execution  not to see them  except they be very great                                           160                return to francis bacon online      search        contact  morgan     at morgan westegg com        page last
