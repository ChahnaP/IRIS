The unemployment rate fell in August from 8.3% to 8.1%, according to the Labor Department report issued Friday, but that slip was fueled by 368,000 people dropping out of the workforce.

The 96,000 jobs added is far below the generally accepted 150,000 needed to simply keep up with population growth, and Obama said that "there is a lot more that we can do."   "We need to create more jobs faster.  We need to fill the hole left by this recession faster. We need to come out of this crisis stronger than when we went in," Obama told voters in Plymouth, New Hampshire.    "When Congress gets back to town next week," he continued, "you need to send them a message: go ahead and give middle class families and small businesses the confidence of knowing that their taxes, your taxes will not go up next year."   The president traveled to the battleground state in the wake of his party's nominating convention, which concluded Thursday evening in Charlotte, North Carolina after Obama accepted the Democratic presidential nomination.  GOP challenger Mitt Romney is to campaign in the Granite State Friday evening.   Romney's running mate, meanwhile, held a rally in Nevada, a battleground state where the unemployment rate is 12%.  Rep. Paul Ryan said at the steamy outdoor event at a Peterbilt Motors Company dealership in Sparks, Nevada the president is "good at giving great speeches, he's just really bad at creating jobs."  "You know we learned today for that every person that got a job, nearly four people stopped looking for a job," the Wisconsin lawmaker said, comparing the 96,000 new jobs and 368,000 people who dropped from the workforce. " They gave up. We can't keep doing this," the Wisconsin lawmaker said  He added, "Friends, this is not an economic recovery, this is nowhere close to an economic recovery. We need a new president and we need a real economic recovery." Obama told supporters Friday "I need four more years" to accomplish a set of goals he laid out in his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday night.   "New Hampshire, I need you to help me recruit a hundred thousand math and science teachers and improve early childhood education and give two million workers the skills they need at community colleges," he said. He also called for deficit reduction, doubling exports in the next two years, and halving imports of oil in the next 8 years in his Thursday evening remarks.   Speaking to reporters in Iowa before Obama's event, Romney said Obama "has been unable to deliver on virtually any of the promises he made when he ran for office four years ago.  "The idea that the American people are going to accept the same promises again would be one that I think would be flying in the face of America's ability to understand what's in their best interest," he said.    Obama has previously blasted Republicans - and they have criticized him - for the standoff over an extension of Bush-era tax breaks which is to expire at the end of this year, absent Congressional action.  Obama and many Democrats favor extending the break on income below a certain threshold - Obama has advocated for $250,000 - while Republicans generally favor extending the break on all levels of income.   The three-day convention had its share of criticism Romney and the Republicans, and on the trail Friday, Obama blasted the GOP for offering "the same prescriptions that they've had for the last 30 years."     "Tax cuts, tax cuts, gut some regulations and, oh, more tax cuts," Obama said.  "Tax cuts when times are good, tax cuts when times are bad, tax cuts to help you lose a few extra pounds.  "Tax cuts to improve your love life," he continued.  "It'll cure anything, according to them."   New Hampshire is one of the nine toss-up states on the CNN Electoral Map.  Obama won the state and its four electoral votes by nine percentage points in the 2008 election.   &#8211; CNN Political Producer Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this report

<title>Francis Bacon | Of Boldness</title>  Francis Bacon | Of Boldness         	 		 			Of Boldness 		 		
 by Francis Bacon  	   	 &#160    	     It is a trivial grammar-school text, but yet worthy a wise man's consideration. Question was asked of Demosthenes, what was the chief part of an orator? he answered, action; what next? action; what next again? action. He said it, that knew it best, and had, by nature, himself no advantage in that he commended. A strange thing, that that of an orator, which is but superficial and rather the virtue of a player, should be placed so high, above those other noble parts, of invention, elocution, and the rest; nay, almost alone, as if it were all in all. But the reason is plain. There is in human nature generally, more of the fool than of the wise; and therefore those faculties, by which the foolish part of men's minds is taken, are most potent. Wonderful like is the case of boldness in civil business: what first? boldness; what second and third? boldness. And yet boldness is a child of ignorance and baseness, far inferior to other parts. But nevertheless it doth fascinate, and bind hand and foot, those that are either shallow in judgment, or weak in courage, which are the greatest part; yea and prevaileth with wise men at weak times. Therefore we see it hath done wonders, in popular states; but with senates, and princes less; and more ever upon the first entrance of bold persons into action, than soon after; for boldness is an ill keeper of promise. Surely, as there are mountebanks for the natural body, so are there mountebanks for the politic body; men that undertake great cures, and perhaps have been lucky, in two or three experiments, but want the grounds of science, and therefore cannot hold out. Nay, you shall see a bold fellow many times do Mahomet's miracle. Mahomet made the people believe that he would call an hill to him, and from the top of it offer up his prayers, for the observers of his law. The people assembled; Mahomet called the hill to come to him, again and again; and when the hill stood still, he was never a whit abashed, but said, If the hill will not come to Mahomet, Mahomet, will go to the hill. So these men, when they have promised great matters, and failed most shamefully, yet (if they have the perfection of boldness) they will but slight it over, and make a turn, and no more ado. Certainly to men of great judgment, bold persons are a sport to behold; nay, and to the vulgar also, boldness has somewhat of the ridiculous. For if absurdity be the subject of laughter, doubt you not but great boldness is seldom without some absurdity. Especially it is a sport to see, when a bold fellow is out of countenance; for that puts his face into a most shrunken, and wooden posture; as needs it must; for in bashfulness, the spirits do a little go and come; but with bold men, upon like occasion, they stand at a stay; like a stale at chess, where it is no mate, but yet the game cannot stir. But this last were fitter for a satire than for a serious observation. This is well to be weighed; that boldness is ever blind; for it seeth not danger, and inconveniences. Therefore it is ill in counsel, good in execution; so that the right use of bold persons is, that they never command in chief, but be seconds, and under the direction of others. For in counsel, it is good to see dangers; and in execution, not to see them, except they be very great.    		  	                             	 &#160    	 		 		  			return to francis bacon online 			| search

<title>Francis Bacon | Of Nobility</title>  Francis Bacon | Of Nobility         	 		 			Of Nobility 		 		
 by Francis Bacon  	   	 &#160    	     We will speak of nobility, first as a portion of an estate, then as a condition of particular persons. A monarchy, where there is no nobility at all, is ever a pure and absolute tyranny; as that of the Turks. For nobility attempers sovereignty, and draws the eyes of the people, somewhat aside from the line royal. But for democracies, they need it not; and they are commonly more quiet, and less subject to sedition, than where there are stirps of nobles. For men's eyes are upon the business, and not upon the persons; or if upon the persons, it is for the business' sake, as fittest, and not for flags and pedigree. We see the Switzers last well, notwithstanding their diversity of religion, and of cantons. For utility is their bond, and not respects. The united provinces of the Low Countries, in their government, excel; for where there is an equality, the consultations are more indifferent, and the payments and tributes, more cheerful. A great and potent nobility, addeth majesty to a monarch, but diminisheth power; and putteth life and spirit into the people, but presseth their fortune. It is well, when nobles are not too great for sovereignty nor for justice; and yet maintained in that height, as the insolency of inferiors may be broken upon them, before it come on too fast upon the majesty of kings. A numerous nobility causeth poverty, and inconvenience in a state; for it is a surcharge of expense; and besides, it being of necessity, that many of the nobility fall, in time, to be weak in fortune, it maketh a kind of disproportion, between honor and means.      As for nobility in particular persons; it is a reverend thing, to see an ancient castle or building, not in decay; or to see a fair timber tree, sound and perfect. How much more, to behold an ancient noble family, which has stood against the waves and weathers of time! For new nobility is but the act of power, but ancient nobility is the act of time. Those that are first raised to nobility, are commonly more virtuous, but less innocent, than their descendants; for there is rarely any rising, but by a commixture of good and evil arts. But it is reason, the memory of their virtues remain to their posterity, and their faults die with themselves. Nobility of birth commonly abateth industry; and he that is not industrious, envieth him that is. Besides, noble persons cannot go much higher; and he that standeth at a stay, when others rise, can hardly avoid motions of envy. On the other side, nobility extinguisheth the passive envy from others, towards them; because they are in possession of honor. Certainly, kings that have able men of their nobility, shall find ease in employing them, and a better slide into their business; for people naturally bend to them, as born in some sort to command.    		  	                             	 &#160    	 		 		  			return to francis bacon online 			| search
