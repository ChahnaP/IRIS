to a legitimacy deficit beetham 1991 or to the delegitimization of a system kelman 2001 linz 1978 thus people might agree with a certain ideology because it describes how they think the system should operate but once they see that the current system is not working the way it should they may perceive injustice and resist the system moore 1978 scott 1976 1985 or possibly devalue the ideology see levy freitas mendoza denton kugelmass 2006 for example people may endorse a criminal justice system that in the abstract protects all residents equally while simultaneously be dissatisfied with the reality that in our criminal justice system people of color face systematic discrimination.we selected ideologies that have been used in prior work on system justification and legitimizing myths equality jost thompson 2000 sidanius pratto 1999 meritocracy sometimes referred to as protestant work ethic jost hunyady 2003 quinn crocker 1999 and democracy manwell 2010 we predicted that everyone would perceive a discrepancy between prescriptive and descriptive ideological beliefs a main effect of beliefs but that this pattern would be more pronounced for low status than high status individuals a belief by status interaction specifically low status members should be just as or more likely than high status members to endorse the prescriptive ideological beliefs however low status members should be less likely than high status members to endorse the descriptive beliefs.people of all statuses endorsed system ideals to promote an ideal system more than to legitimize the actual system study 2 however high status people were slightly more likely to endorse system ideals to legitimize the actual system than low status people study 3 in summary low status people were more likely than high status people to recognize discrepancies between system goals and system outcomes show dissatisfaction with the american system and prefer policies that would attenuate extant hierarchies.descriptive beliefs then they will be more satisfied with the system and less likely to support policies that promote changes to the system hochschild 2006 overview of studies the purpose of studies 1 3 was to examine people s perceptions of how society actually operates descriptive beliefs and whether these views are congruent with or divergent from their views of what should be occurring in society prescriptive beliefs we are particularly interested in investigating whether people s status influences these perceptions.conversely those of low status would endorse these beliefs in an effort to transform the system studies 2 and 3 similarly we expected that those who perceive less of a discrepancy between prescriptive and descriptive beliefs would endorse prescriptive beliefs to perpetuate the existing system but those that perceive more of a discrepancy would endorse prescriptive ideologies in an effort to transform the system.</content></resource><resource><id>2</id><content type="summarized">for example a pancultural value hierarchy appears to lie hidden behind the obvious differences between cultures all over the world people consider values of benevolence and universalism important but values of power unimportant schwartz 2006 2007 schwartz bardi 2001 furthermore women tend to find values of self transcendence and conservation more important than men whereas men tend to find values of self enhancement and openness to change more important than women schwartz rubel 2005 it seems reasonable to assume that the ground for these and other cross cultural patterns is laid in early childhood.answers to the question how much is this person like you are to be given for each vignette on a 6 point scale 1 very much like me and 6 not at all like me back to top data analysis back to top structural analyses pearson correlation coefficient matrices from the responses to the 21 pvq items provided the basis for our structural analyses of values which were conducted using ordinal multidimensional scaling mds mds has been a central tool of psychological research on value structure in the past and it is usually used in an exploratory way.2006 for instance point to a reconceptualization of the child s role in the process of value transmission while traditional approaches portrayed the child in line with piaget and kohlberg as a preconventional and egocentric thinker who reacts to the incentives and sanctions provided by adults recent approaches portray the child as an intuitive moralist thompson et al.10 to 12 years boehnke welzel 2006 bubeck bilsky 2004 d ring 2010 knafo spinath 2011 and there is hardly any research at all on values of children under 10 years of age cieciuch harasimczuk d ring 2010 d ring blauensteiner aryus dr gekamp bilsky 2010 although evidence on the content and structure of human values at this early age is scarce so far the existing findings encourage researchers to further follow this path bubeck and bilsky 2004 cieciuch et al.hofstede 1980 inglehart 1977 rokeach 1973 schwartz 1992 one of the most fruitful theories on the content and structure of human values one that has also proved to be a conceptually and empirically appropriate and sound approach for cross cultural investigations was developed by schwartz 1992 schwartz conceives values as transsituational concepts or beliefs about desirable goals that vary in importance and serve as guiding principles in people s lives.</content></resource><resource><id>6</id><content type="summarized">thus two feedback loops were created in which the impact of feedback on goal setting and performance could be tested the feedback received after the first time the task was performed allowed us to analyze the impact of feedback on subsequent goal setting and on task performance when the task was performed the second time first feedback loop the second feedback loop included the feedback received after the second time the task was performed subsequent goal setting and task performance when the task was performed the third time.in the first condition participants received positive feedback twice positive positive in the second they received negative feedback twice negative negative participants in the third condition received negative feedback after performing the first task and positive feedback after performing the second task negative positive in the fourth condition participants received positive feedback after the first task performance and negative feedback after the second task positive negative back to top task performance to investigate the impact of feedback on performance we chose a task to measure selective attention.abstract this research project was undertaken in response to kluger and denisi s 1996 call for more primary studies to investigate specific propositions of the feedback intervention theory fit to study the assumptions of fit on the level of task motivation processes we analyzed the impact of combined positive and negative feedback.the following hypotheses were deduced in contrast to positive feedback raising the standard after receiving negative feedback offers the possibility of decreasing the relevance of repeated negative feedback due to awareness of the increased level of difficulty.proprioceptive perceptions in a motor task butler winne 1995 magill 2001 narciss 2008 in line with this notion narciss 2008 suggested the existence of two feedback loops one that involved the comparison of internal feedback to an internal reference value derived from a subjective estimation of task demands and another that involved the comparison of external feedback to an external reference value mainly derived from external information i.</content></resource></resourceList><clientID>1</clientID></parameters>
