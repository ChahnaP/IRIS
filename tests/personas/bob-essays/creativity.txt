There is robust evidence for a relationship between regulatory focus and creative cognition with prevention states undermining creative insight and promotion states facilitating it We tested whether similar effects occur as a result of priming goal standards related to prevention focus ought standards versus promotion focus ideal standards A pilot study established that the importance placed on ought versus ideal selfstandards predicted the desire to be creative with the strongest creativity orientation observed among participants who placed a high value on achieving goals related to ideal standards and a low value on achieving goals related to ought standards Two experiments then demonstrated that goal priming influenced the novelty of responses to a word association task with activation of ought standards decreasing and activation of ideal evaluative standards increasing novelty Study 2 revealed that the influence of goal priming was eliminated when participants were put under time pressure suggesting that this manipulation exerted influence on response novelty through a controlled as opposed to spontaneous process  People are most creative when they are intrinsically motivated valuing creativity for its own sake Azzam 2009 Cskszentmihlyi 1999 Paris et al 2006 This seems to suggest that one way to promote creativity is to teach people to value it but the literature on goal pursuits suggests that there is reason to question such a straightforward prediction Goals can take different forms leading to different results In the current studies we considered two distinct ways of approaching creative pursuits that are derived from Higgins selfdiscrepancy theory 1987 and his later 1998 regulatory focus model We propose that an intrinsic interest in creativity is beneficial when people are motivated to be creative as an expression of their hopes and ideals whereas intrinsic interest is harmful when it is associated with a sense of duty or obligation  SelfGuides and Regulatory Focus Interest in creativity is just one of many actions that can be shaped through normal socialization Early in normal development much of socialization is focused toward bringing order and selfcontrol to a childs life Children are potty trained learn to say please and thank you to tell the truth not to steal and so on As children enter adolescence and move beyond they learn progressively more complex and abstract codes of conduct Higgins 1987 termed the internalized evaluative standards that guide such civilized actions ought selfguides These are representations of the attributes that young actors learn they should possess out of a sense of duty obligation and social responsibility But not all actions are dictated by duty Through normal socialization children also develop the values that guide their aspirational pursuits In Higgins model the internalized standards that guide these actions are termed ideal selfguides These are representations of attributes that are not dictated so much by obligation or responsibility as by the actors own hopes wishes and personal ambition Higgins 1998 proposed that these two internalized standards are tied to two distinct motivational orientations Because duty and responsibility are typically taught through the delivery and threat of punishment ought selfguides lead individuals to adopt a prevention focus Prevention focus is characterized by the pursuit of safety and avoidance of unwanted outcomes A much different dynamic is associated with ideal selfguides Because hopes and aspirations are typically cultivated through the delivery and promise of praise and admiration ideal selfguides lead individuals to adopt a promotion focus Promotion focus is characterized by a desire to seek and attain positive outcomes Importantly people differ in their overall concern for achieving their ideals versus living up to their obligations and so they differ in their general tendencies toward promotion and prevention see Higgins 1998 However all individuals should be motivated to some extent by a mix of both ought and ideal selfguides As a result situations that momentarily activate interest in ought fulfillment can orient a person toward prevention focus whereas situations that momentarily activate interest in ideal attainment can orient a person toward promotion focus  Regulatory Focus and Creativity To our knowledge research has not directly linked selfguide activation to creative pursuits Such work is important however as it might more fully inform educators on the best way to cultivate intrinsic creativity motivation Should one teach creativity as an ideal that individuals should strive to achieve or as a duty that one has a responsibility to exhibit Although there is a paucity of work addressing this specific question considerable attention has been given to the effect of promotion versus prevention focus on creativity In general individuals high in promotion focus have been shown to engage in more flexible and creative thinking whereas those high in prevention focus have been shown to be lower on these dimensions eg Frster and Dannenberg 2010 Friedman and Frster 2001 2002 Studies also suggest that situations that activate promotionfocused states result in greater creativity than situations that activate preventionfocused states typically induced by procedures that focus attention on achieving positive outcomes Baas De Dreu and Nijstad 2008 Frster and Dannenberg 2010 Friedman and Frster 2001 2002 Researchers have also manipulated regulatory focus by directly framing the incentives for a creativity task or by indirectly priming approach versus avoidance mindsets An example of direct goal priming can be found in Lam and Chiu 2002 They instructed participants taking a creative task to imagine that their own good performance would increase chances of achieving a positive outcome being admitted to a professional school or avoiding a negative outcome being rejected by a professional school An example of indirect goal priming can be found in a series of studies by Friedman and Frster 2001 2005 They manipulated a regulatory focus state through use of a maze task Participants were instructed to find a solution to a maze that would help a mouse either find cheese promotion focus or avoid a predator prevention focus Combined the literature relying on such methods suggests that promotion focus bolsters creative thought creative idea generation and improves memory search for novel responses whereas prevention focuses works against these effects  Creativity SelfGuides Research on regulatory focus provides a strong basis for hypothesizing links between motivational systems and creative output but it does not speak directly to an issue that might be of concern to many educators Specifically how should creativity be linked to ones selfconcept and what broad goal orientations will promote creative pursuits We suggest that creativity is best internalized as an ideal as this should trigger a promotion regulatory focus that is compatible with this goal In contrast if creativity is internalized as an ought then this should trigger a prevention regulatory focus that is incompatible with this goal We tested this logic in an initial pilot study and two experiments The pilot study first tested for the presence of a correlational link between the chronic concerns for ideal versus ought selfguides and the desire to be creative The two experimental studies then adapted a new priming procedure to activate ought versus ideal selfguides to determine whether this resulted in corresponding shifts in creative output  Pilot Study  Method Participants were 48 college students n  33 women who completed three measures as part of pretesting for a separate study The first two measures assessed the importance of ought and ideal pursuits and the third measured the importance of creativity Goal orientation was measured for both ought and ideal pursuits by having participants rate the importance of attributes associated with each pursuit With respect to ought standards participants listed three traits that they should possess in the future if they live up to their personal feelings of obligation and duty With respect to ideal standards participants listed three traits that they will possess in the future if they live up to their personal ideals Participants then rated the set of ought and ideal pursuits in overall importance on a scale from 0 not at all important to 6 extremely important and these two ratings became the estimate of each standards importance After completing a series of unrelated distractor questionnaires tapping selfesteem and campus attitudes participants then made a set of ratings related to creativity They rated the importance of being creative in their own lives and their past history of being creative using the same 7point scale as in the other questions These two ratings were highly correlated r  57 p  001 and so we collapsed them into a single index1  Results and Discussion The importance of ought and ideal pursuits was modestly correlated r44  24 p  06 suggesting that some individuals were more strongly motivated in general than others They were far from redundant however making it realistic to examine their independent relationship with creativity This was tested by regressing creativity orientation on the importance given to ought and ideal pursuits The main effects were obtained in the first block of the equation This block yielded a significant negative regression weight for ought standards B  075 t45  729 p  01 and a significant positive regression weight for ideal standards B  066 t45  599 p  01 These findings indicate that the importance participants placed on being creative decreased the more they valued ought pursuits but increased the more they valued ideal pursuits2 In the second regression block we entered the interaction term multiplicative crossproduct for ought and ideal pursuits so that we could determine whether there was a statistical interaction between the importance of ought and ideal pursuits in the prediction of creativity importance Blanton and Jaccard 2006 This analysis revealed a significant statistical interaction between the two selfguides B  015 t44  221 p  03 The pattern of this interaction is charted in Figure 1 This shows that individuals who placed the highest value on being creative also showed a combination of high concern for ideals and low concern for oughts These results thus offer preliminary support to our model The obvious shortcomings of this brief pilot are its reliance on selfreport and the correlational nature of the results Two experiments were thus designed to address these limitations by experimentally manipulating the salience of ought or ideal concerns and then measuring their effect on creative responding in an experimental task Graphic Figure 1 Study 1  Overview This study investigated the influence of semantic goal primes on creativity Creativity was assessed using a word association test Eysenck 1995 Although word associations tap only some specific aspects of creative cognition they show significant correlations with various measures of creativity Benedek Knen and Neubauer 2012 Gough 1976 and personality traits such as psychosis proneness Merten 1993 Ward McConaghy and Catts 1991 and were ideal for our purposes because they permit precise quantification of the novelty of a given response By comparing the associations produced with population norms Palermo and Jenkins 1964 we were able to test theories regarding the importance placed on novel creative responding3  Method A sample of 113 students n  88 women participated in a study presented as a project measuring word associations Participants completed a computer task that asked them to type the first word that came to mind after a target word was presented The computer program presented each participant with an empty box followed by a numeric sequence that counted down from 3 to 1 Following this a target word appeared Participants were instructed to enter a word in the box To discourage participants from moving so quickly through the task that dominant word associations might take over the instructions stated that participants need not type the first word that came to mind The task that followed was designed to accomplish two things It primed participants with goal words typically associated with ought evaluative standards or ideal evaluative standards for those in the control condition it presented them with a set of control words These words were chosen based on synonym searches related to ought obligation and moral and were correctly categorized by at least 80 of participants in a sample of 24 college participants see the Appendix Novelty was then assessed by measuring responses to nonprime assessment words The goal words and the assessment words were presented in a nonrandom orderone that was designed to activate and then maintain the salience of relevant constructs while at the same time measuring resulting influences on creativity For those participants who had ought or ideal goal word primes the first three target words were designed to activate concerns related to ethics and duty morality required ought or achievement and accomplishment achieve victory ideal After each of these words participants listed the word association that came to mind This activityof observing a goal word and then generating a relevant associationwas developed as a means of activating mindsets related to the pursuit of ideal or ought goals Immediately after these three primes participants were presented with two trials that presented assessment words eg eagle sell Their task was again to list associations to these words Participants entered the words that came to mind for these words as they did for the goal words For the remaining trials of the task the program alternated between presenting an additional goal word followed by two assessment words It repeated this sequence until the program exhausted a list of 13 goalrelated primes and 22 assessment words The sequence for stimuli presentation in the control condition was identical to the two experimental conditions except that the goalpriming words were chosen to have no relevance to either ought or ideal pursuits eg whistle cabbage The complete list of prime and target words in the task is presented in the Appendix in the order they appeared in the priming task We assessed novelty with a binary rating that coded whether participants listed the most common association for a given prime as determined by word norms documented in studies by Palermo and Jenkins 1964 on word association norms For instance this text identified the most common word association for eagle to be bird and for sell to be buy Participants who chose these words were not given credit for providing a creative answer Those who chose words such as falcon or purchase did receive a score for creativity With 22 target words creativity scores thus ranged from 0 to 22 Because our priming procedure might influence mood which can exert general influences selfregulation independent of regulatory focus Higgins 2000 as well as creative cognition Baas et al 2008 participants finished the study by completing the 20item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule PANAS Watson Clark and Tellegen 1988 so that any potential confounding influences of primes on mood could be measured and controlled  Results The influence of priming on creative responding was determined by conducting threecell oneway analysis of variance ANOVA on novelty of associations to test for differences among participants in ought n  39 ideal n  37 or control n  37 conditions This revealed a significant effect of condition on novel responding F2 110  807 p  01 The nature of this effect was that participants exposed to ideal primes related to achievement and accomplishment produced more creative word associations M  1141 SD  249 than did those in the control condition M  1005 SD  267 t110  411 p  01 whereas those in the ought condition exposed to primes related to duty and obligation produced fewer creative words M  902 SD  259 t110  245 p  05 than those in the control condition To gain some insight into the underlying processes leading to these shifts we examined response latencies recording the time between target onset and completion of the word association entry and found no significant differences between conditions Fs  1 This suggests that participants in the experimental conditions were not speeding up or slowing down to choose more creative words However this finding should be viewed with caution as individual differences in typing speed and chosen word length were quite large and so the response latency data in this study were too noisy for drawing strong inference Finally we observed no effects of primes on positive or negative affect Fs  1 and controlling for momentary affect did not influence statistical significance of analyses examining the influence of regulatory priming on creativity  Study 2  Method The purpose of Study 2 was to gain some insight into the mechanisms underlying these shifts The first study was structured to minimize competition with dominant word associations Participants were given explicit instructions not to focus only on the first word that came to mind It is possible that the first word that came to mind was similar across conditions but participants in ideal condition resisted the pull of the obvious to make more novel associations In contrast those in the ought condition might have held back on responding until they thought of a word that seemed common enough to feel appropriate If such an account is true then one might predict that there would be observable differences in the time of responding between the two experimental conditions and the control No such difference was observed but the noisiness of reaction time data for this type of task prevents strong interpretation of this null finding To critically examine the stage at which the primes influenced novelty and whether the responses in Study 1 suggest a relatively controlled influence of evaluative standards we designed Experiment 2 to introduce a new condition speeded responding This study employed the same procedure as Study 1 only this time incorporating a 2 instruction set high or low time pressure  2 prime ought vs ideal evaluative standards factorial design with 25 participants per experimental condition Those in the lowtimepressure condition were given the same instructions as in Study 1 In contrast those in the hightimepressure condition were instructed to type the first word that comes to mind in the box provided From comparisons between the high and lowtimepressure conditions in Study 2 analyses could investigate whether the changes observed in Study 2 likely occurred spontaneously or whether they instead required a degree of cognitive control As in Study 1 the PANAS was administered after the priming procedure to test for mood influences  Results A 2 instruction set  2 prime factorial ANOVA revealed a significant interaction only between priming condition and speed F1 96  443 p  04 The nature of this effect was that in the lowtimepressure condition participants in the ought condition produced significantly fewer creative word associations M  960 SD  191 than those in the creative prime condition M  1128 SD  228 t96  255 p  01 This pattern replicated the results of Study 1 In contrast participants in the speeded condition showed no difference between those in the ought condition M  1028 SD  151 and those in the ideal condition M  1000 SD  255 t  1 Examination of the response latencies associated with responding indicated that individuals in the lowtimepressure condition took an additional 23 s to respond p  001 but there were no differences or interactions due to the nature of the prime These results suggest that the differences in novelty observed in Study 1 reflected some degree of cognitive control over responding with participants moving either in a more conventional less creative direction when ought concerns were activated or in a less conventional more creative direction when ideal concerns were activated Under speeded conditions the dominant word associations drove responding and there was no influence of primes Finally no effects of priming or instruction set on positive or negative mood were observed ps  20 and entering these scores as a covariate did not influence the statistical significance of analyses investigating the influence of regulatory primes on creativity  General Discussion It is generally accepted that creativity flows best from an intrinsic motivation to be creative The current study introduced a potential caveat to that by studying indirect links between trait interest pilot study and state activation Studies 1 and 2 of selfguides as predictors of creative output The pilot study established that the desire to be creative was lowest among people who place a high value on living up to duty and obligation in the form of ought selfguides and little value on personal achievement in the form of ideal selfguides Two experimental studies then manipulated the salience of these two goal orientations and showed that activation of ought selfguides inhibited creative output whereas activation of ideal selfguides facilitated it The experimental studies offered additional evidence into the manner by which these two internalized goal sets influence creative output Study 1 demonstrated that relative to controls priming of motivational states related to achievement and accomplishment led to more novel word associations and priming of motivational states related to duty and obligation led to less novel word associations These findings complement the considerable research linking regulatory focus to creative cognition Baas et al 2008 Frster and Dannenberg 2010 Friedman and Frster 2001 2002 by tying creativity to the goal standards that are an important determinant of regulatory focus Moretti and Higgins 1999 Study 2 replicated these effects but showed that the original result was eliminated on speeded trials This pattern suggests that goal activation influenced creative expression not creative cognition Put another way we do not assume or believe that priming influenced accessibility of different words Rather we believe that ideal priming motivated participants to take the time they needed to think of more novel word choices perhaps skipping the more accessible less creative choices that came to mind first In contrast ought priming did not motivate participants to take the time for creative pursuits perhaps leading them to choose the first word that was sufficient to the instructions to produce a word This interpretation is compatible with research on the serial order effect Christensen Guilford and Wilson 1957 argued that mundane ideas come to mind before novel ones and that individual differences in creativity are marked by the tendency to suppress mundane responses until creative ideas manifest  Creative Conformity Our analysis might offer a deceptively straightforward approach to promoting creativity It suggests that educators should encourage students to view creativity as an ideal they should strive to achieve rather than as a duty they are obliged to perform This is a reasonable interpretation but there is a complication Blanton and Christie 2003 reviewed evidence suggesting that it is difficult to use ideals to promote actions of a group because ideals motivate individuals to distinguish themselves from the group Whereas all individuals who adhere to the same ought moral and social codes are obligated to follow certain prescribed courses of action eg to be truthful to avoid harming others not to yell fire in a movie theater the same cannot be said of their ideals One individual might aspire to be a musician another an actor and another a social psychologist Each of these individuals is free to pursue his or her distinct ideals even if each is also bound to a shared sense of obligation This analysis points to a challenge of motivating creative output as an ideal Ideals promote unique choices and so efforts to promote creativity as an ideal to pursue work against that very function If an educator promotes creativity as an ideal in a large group no single member can express his or her uniqueness by internalizing a shared goal And there is another problem If an educator were successful in getting a group of students to pursue less mundane solutions the teacher would effectively alter the definition of mundane Consider that the novelty of any given individuals expression is intimately tied to most definitions of the creativity of that act Sternberg and Lubart 1999 Torrance 1974 In our laboratory task for instance participants were designated as creative to the extent that they broke from the population norm for word associations Imagine however if the ideal condition were run hundreds more times Over time if this intervention continued to exert influence on groups of students a new norm would be established for this population of individuals in the ideal condition and so by definition the majority would no longer be designated as creative Our creativity manipulation might thus have the ironic effect of creating a new norm and thus a new way for the majority to be mundane We think the lesson here is not to abandon the emphasis on treating creativity as an ideal Educators have a role to play and we think it is better served by promoting creativity as an ideal rather than an obligation However the lesson from this analysis is that ideals are probably less useful when used to promote specific ways of acting creatively This point is obscured by our choice of methods In our study participants had no choice but to make word associations and when ideals were triggered they responded by thinking outside a particular normative box In real life however individuals who are taught to value creativity as an ideal have the freedom to define the tasks that interest them and to define their own metrics of success Perhaps one idealistic student will become an actor and another a musician If a third student decides she also wants to act or create music she can do so in ways that let her maintain a distinct identity In contrast if she felt that she had to perform such actions out of a sense of duty she might treat the first two individuals as specific models for how she could satisfy her obligation We thus view the promotion of creative ideals in education as a general means of releasing interest in being creativein some form or anothernot as a strategy for promoting any specific creative pursuit or any specific creative expression of that pursuit  Limitations and Future Directions These studies were designed to build on prior work demonstrating regulatory links to creative cognition by providing a direct test of an association between self standards and creative cognition We established that such links are viable but our findings are limited by the narrow range of phenomena studied First we only examined selfreported interest in creativity and novelty of word associations in our pilot study This work would benefit from consideration of other markers of creativity and other forms of creative insight and expression see Cropley 2000 Of more critical concern is the need to examine more fully the complex interplay between goal pursuit and goal attainment Evaluative standards can have different influences on individuals depending on whether individuals feel that they have lived up to those goals or not Higgins 1987 We did not examine whether selfdiscrepancy influences creative production but such an effect might have been observed if we had compared individuals who felt they were making progress on their goals with those who did not feel that way Recent research suggests that selfdiscrepancy may be important at least for understanding the influence of ought standards on creative expression Baas De Dreu and Nijstad 2011 found that although promotionfocused states generally increase creativity prevention states could increase or diminish creativity depending on progress made Specifically it was only when participants felt that their prevention goals were mostly achieved that a prevention focus resulted in reduced creative expression In contrast when participants felt their prevention goals were not yet achieved those states were linked to more creative cognition Internal analysis suggested that this occurred because when prevention goals are frustrated individuals become more engaged and thus more creative These findings suggest that had we prescreened for individuals with large discrepancies between their current states and ought selfguides see Higgins 1987 ought activation might have promoted more creative cognition Future research will benefit from greater attention to these and other differences in how people construe evaluative standards as they relate to creative cognition  Conclusion With these caveats in mind our findings suggest that the way people approach their goals can influence creative output Creativity seems most likely when the individual is striving to express an ideal not when the individual is responding out of a sense of obligation
