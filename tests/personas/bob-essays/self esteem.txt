Is it possible to maintain a positive perspective on the self into very old age Empirical research so far is rather inconclusive with some studies reporting substantial declines in selfesteem late in life whereas others report relative stability into old age In this article we examine longterm change trajectories in selfesteem in old age and very old age and link them to key correlates in the health cognitive selfregulatory and social domains To do so we estimated growth curve models over chronological age and timetodeath using 18year longitudinal data from the Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing N  1215 age 65103 years at first occasion M  788 years SD  59 women 45 of sample Results revealed that selfesteem was on average fairly stable with minor declines only emerging in advanced ages and at the very end of life Examination of the vast betweenperson differences revealed that lower cognitive abilities and lower perceived control independently related to lower selfesteem Also lower cognitive abilities were associated with steeper agerelated and mortalityrelated selfesteem decrements In our discussion we consider a variety of challenges that potentially shape selfesteem late in life and highlight the need for more mechanismoriented research to better understand the pathways underlying stability and change in selfesteem  One major theme of personality and life span research has long been whether and how key aspects of the self are preserved when people are faced with major challenges of late life M M Baltes and Carstensen 1996 Brandtstdter and Greve 1994 Cross and Markus 1991 Freund and Smith 1999 Orth Trzesniewski and Robins 2010 Robins Trzesniewski Tracy Gosling and Potter 2002 Troll and Skaff 1997 One important indicator of the self is selfesteem which revolves around a general evaluation and appraisal of ones worth Leary and Baumeister 2000 Orth Robins and Widaman 2011 Selfregulation theories emphasize the adaptive capacities of the selfsystem Brandtstdter and Renner 1990 Brickman and Campbell 1971 Charles and Carstensen 2010 However empirical findings on selfesteem in old age are rather inconclusive with some studies reporting sizeable declines Orth et al 2010 Shaw Liang and Krause 2010 whereas others report relative stability into old age Huang 2010 Marsh Martin and Jackson 2010 In our study we moved several steps beyond extant research by focusing on a phase of life namely very old age during which selfregulatory mechanisms that usually keep the self stable may reach their limits P B Baltes and Smith 2003 Specifically we examined selfesteem trajectories over a broad age range of 35 years across old and very old ages 65103 years and investigated whether and how selfesteem changes in the last years of life We also explored some of the factors that may contribute to the betweenperson heterogeneity that is often observed in selfesteem trajectories Erol and Orth 2011 Going this route allowed us to better understand how variables in the health cognitive selfregulatory and social domains shape selfesteem late in life To do so we applied latent growth curve models to 18year longitudinal data obtained from 1215 by now deceased participants from the Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing ALSA  Stability or Change in SelfEsteem in Old Age It has long been proposed that people have an inherent need to feel good about themselves James 18901950 Accordingly selfesteem is considered a fundamental human concern Bushman Moeller and Crocker 2011 Sheldon Elliot Kim and Kasser 2001 and has become one of the most investigated constructs in psychological research Leary 1999 Despite this long and rich history of research there is little established knowledge about the normative trajectories of change that selfesteem exhibits in old age In particular studies converge in reporting that average levels of selfesteem are relatively stable or even increase until people reach retirement age whereas highly divergent results are often reported for postretirement ages For example Orth et al 2010 reported in one of the few longitudinal studies that populationlevel differences in selfesteem between ages of 60 and 97 amounted to d  068 see also Shaw et al 2010 In a crosssectional study Robins et al 2002 also found average levels of selfesteem to decline in late adulthood but the amount of declines was shallower d  008 in the 60s through the 70s and d  029 in the 70s through the 80s In contrast other studies have reported that selfesteem remains fairly robust even in old age Huang 2010 Marsh et al 2010 Pullmann Allik and Realo 2009 Wagner Lang Neyer and Wagner 2012 For example Huang in his 2010 metaanalysis reported that average differences between ages 50 and 60 years were d  07 and average differences for ages 60 and older were minimal as well d  007 We note that the relative scarcity of longitudinal data and of observations obtained from people in their 80s and 90s precludes drawing more conclusive inferences about how selfesteem develops in old and especially very old age see also Huang 2010 Trzesniewski Donnellan and Robins 2003 Why would selfesteem be stable across old age or why would it change To begin with theories of selfregulation have long highlighted that adaptive capacities are robust well into late life Brandtstdter and Renner 1990 Brickman and Campbell 1971 Charles and Carstensen 2010 For example people may come to terms with losses and unattainable goals by adjusting their aspiration levels or by disengaging from initially important goals and thereby maintain a coherent sense of themselves see Heckhausen and Schulz 1995 Indeed several lines of empirical work have provided convincing support of adaptive aging eg possible selves Smith and Freund 2002 emotion regulation Carstensen Fung and Charles 2003 social integration Wrzus Kckeritz Wagner and Neyer 2012 It thus appears reasonable to assume that people adjust on average reasonably well to the changes imposed by transitions into retirement eg fewer financial possibilities loss of social roles obsolete occupational expertise and skills see Orth et al 2010 Although these processes appear to be highly efficient throughout adulthood and old age it is possible that the nature of change often imposed by advanced old age challenges selfregulatory capacity to the point where it reaches its limits P B Baltes and Smith 2003 Gerstorf and Ram 2009 Gerstorf Ram Lindenberger and Smith in press First of all people are increasingly at risk of being confronted with transitions or critical life events that are outside their control particularly those that are almost normative for very old people such as declining health eg disability or social losses eg bereavement These challenges may simply become too frequent or too severe in advanced old age thereby making adjustment more and more difficult Second the selfregulation system itself may become increasingly compromised and capabilities that have worked highly efficiently across adulthood to recover from perturbations become more and more fragile for example due to cognitive limitations  SelfEsteem Trajectories at the End of Life Reaching back to seminal work in the 1960s and 1970s Kleemeier 1962 Palmore and Cleveland 1976 Riegel and Riegel 1972 Siegler 1975 it has long been established that latelife changes are often not only influenced by agerelated factors but also by factors related to approaching death In particular the terminal decline concept suggests that progressive mechanisms leading toward death fundamentally shape the course and nature of changes that often accompany the last years and months of life Empirical studies examining how mortalityrelated processes unfold have described and extracted systematic withinperson changes in individuals behavior and experience along a timetodeath time axis for an alternative approach see Ghisletta McArdle and Lindenberger 2006 Evidence for precipitous proximatetodeath declines that are often considerably steeper than the typical agerelated effects has primarily accumulated in cognitive ability domains for overviews see Bckman and MacDonald 2006 S Berg 1996 Small and Bckman 1999 However there is an increasing body of research showing that many aspects of wellbeing also show steep endoflife declines A I Berg Hassing Thorvaldsson and Johansson 2011 Diehr Williamson Burke and Psaty 2002 Gerstorf et al 2008 2010 Mroczek and Spiro 2005 Palgi et al 2010 There is even initial evidence to suggest that terminal decline is a highly pervasive phenomenon that affects many different domains including those often considered relatively stable across old and very old age Gerstorf et al in press It is an open question whether people manage to maintain a reasonably positive view of the self until the very last phase of life Based on the previously described considerations one may expect selfesteem to exhibit latelife deterioration as well The overarching question is whether selfprotective processes are still resilient enough to help people adjust to the likely losses they are faced with or whether the pervasive nature of endoflife decrements pushes individuals adaptive capacities to their limits The initial evidence suggests that some domains particularly in the sensory cognitive and health areas are more prone to mortalityrelated change than other domains particularly in the selfregulation and social areas Gerstorf et al in press For example linear mortalityrelated declines amounted to an average of 16 SD units in the last 10 years for the cognitive marker the Digit Letter Test for details see Lindenberger and Baltes 1997 and 09 SD units for the selfregulatory marker perceived control These preliminary reports from other partly related domains eg perceived control Erol and Orth 2011 suggest that the last years of life may be accompanied by accelerated deteriorations in selfesteem but that the overall effect size of those changes is probably smaller relative to the effects observed in other domains  Correlates of LateLife SelfEsteem Trajectories Extant research on factors contributing to betweenperson differences in selfesteem has revealed that feedback from peers Leary and Baumeister 2000 Leary Tambor Terdal and Downs 1995 and relationship with parents Harter 2006 Ojanen and Perry 2007 as well as achievements Marsh and Craven 2006 Trautwein Ldtke Kller and Baumert 2006 along with athletic competences and physical appearance Harter 1993 2006 are all crucial correlates of selfesteem in the first half of life For example Harter 2006 illustrated that adolescents transition from elementary school to junior high school is often accompanied by considerable changes in selfesteem and that such shifts are mostly due to a change in how successful adolescents are in important domains of life However less is known about the sources and correlates of selfesteem in old age Some of these sources such as the ones in the work domain are no longer available after people have reached retirement ages As a consequence other factors may become increasingly important These factors can be important sources of selfesteem but they can also represent risk factors as we will later detail In the current study we assumed that sociodemographic variables as well as variables in the health cognitive selfregulatory and social domains are of key importance in determining selfesteem late in life To begin with gender differences in selfesteem have long been reported from samples of young and middleaged adults typically with higher selfesteem among men relative to women Kling Hyde Showers and Buswell 1999 However there is evidence to suggest that these differences are considerably smaller in old age Orth et al 2010 Robins et al 2002 or even nonexistent Huang 2010 probably because late life is related to less strict social and role expectations Freund 2000 Education can be regarded as a generalpurpose resource that links to a variety of factors ranging from finances to coping strategies that often help individuals achieve their goals and deal efficiently with changing living conditions Consistent with this idea people with higher educational achievements were repeatedly found to report higher selfesteem Orth et al 2010 Shaw et al 2010 Finally studies of young adults have revealed that being single is related to lower selfesteem particularly among men Lehnart Neyer and Eccles 2010 Neyer and Lehnart 2007 Wagner Ldtke Jonkmann and Trautwein in press This is argued to be due to the normativity of establishing a first partnership in young adulthood However given that living without a partner is much more common when people are in their 80s and 90s we would not expect considerable differences related to marital status anymore As a second set of crucial selfesteem correlates in late life we examined variables in the health domain Previous studies have indicated that people who reported being in good health also reported higher selfesteem Orth et al 2010 Reitzes and Mutran 2006 Shaw et al 2010 To move toward a more comprehensive health assessment we made use of three indicators a medical checklist reporting the current chronic medical conditions functional limitations and disabilities and selfrated health As a marker of cognitive abilities we chose perceptual speed which is highly reliable and sensitive to change throughout adulthood Anstey Hofer and Luszcz 2003 Gerstorf Hoppmann Anstey and Luszcz 2009 and as a cognitive primitive is conceptually closer to a resource than other cognitive abilities Luszcz and Bryan 1999 As a fourth set of correlates we drew from conceptual and empirical work highlighting the role of perceived control for successful aging Heckhausen Wrosch and Schulz 2010 Infurna Gerstorf Robertson Berg and Zarit 2010 Specifically perceptions of and strivings for control appear to play a pivotal role in the context of active selfesteem recovery after loss or failure for example through the use of selfprotective strategies such as goal disengagement or downward comparison Such control strategies are important throughout the life span but may become particularly important with the increased risks of loss experiences in old age see also Brandtstdter 1999 Aspects of perceived control have indeed been linked with shaping selfesteem in early adulthood Erol and Orth 2011 and we examined such associations in a later phase of life A final correlate revolves around the social domain For example consistent with sociometer theory selfesteem often shows strong associations with social inclusion and positive social interactions Denissen Penke Schmitt and van Aken 2008 Leary and Baumeister 2000 Leary et al 1995 Because close social relationships constitute a relatively stable and important aspect of latelife functioning Lang and Carstensen 2002 Wrzus et al 2012 we expected to find that the social domain continues to play a key role in shaping peoples selfesteem Taken together a thorough investigation of the role of these factors promised to help identify some of the risk factors for and protective living conditions against selfesteem decline late in life  The Present Study In the current study we examined whether and how selfesteem changes at the end of life and explored factors that contribute to betweenperson differences in such change To do so we applied growth models to longterm longitudinal data over chronological age and timetodeath metrics from 1215 deceased participants in the ALSA As an extension of studies examining how selfesteem changes when people are in their 60s and 70s we expected selfesteem to show considerable decline in people in their 80s and 90s and in those approaching death We also expected that variables in the health cognitive selfregulatory and social domains would shape the course of selfesteem change late in life  Method  Procedure This report was based on the Australian Longitudinal Study of Aging ALSA Luszcz 1998 The ALSA is a populationbased psychobiosocial and behavioral study with participants from Adelaide Australia The first wave of data collection started in 1992 and since then 10 followup waves with varying study intervals have been conducted The study consists of an extensive personal interview including among other things psychosocial behavioral social and contextual variables Detailed information on study procedures and constructs can be found in Andrews Clark and Luszcz 2002 Anstey et al 2003 and Luszcz Bryan and Kent 1997  Participants At baseline in 1992 the ALSA sample comprised 2087 participants stratified by age and gender into four cohorts 7074 years 7579 years 8084 years and 85  years age M  7816 SD  669 range  65103 years with those 85 years and older as well as men being oversampled Information about mortality status of participants was updated in July 2011 from city registries when 825 or 1722 of the original participants were known to have died With an interest in latelife changes we included in our report all ALSA participants who a were deceased by July 2011 and b had contributed one or more waves of selfesteem data in the last 10 years of life resulting in a sample of 1215 old and very old adults who were 65 through 103 years old at baseline M  788 SD  59 men were 55 of the sample About 54 had left school by age 14 or younger The majority of participants were married 66 Included in our study were all participants who provided valid data on key measures of our study selfesteem social participation As a consequence it was not possible to compare participants included in our report with those not included on these key measures However information for those not included was available on most other variables Thus selectivity analyses with all participants at Time 1 T1 and those included in the current sample showed that those included participants were more likely to be male d  020 have had a higher education d  014 have reported more medical conditions d  019 and have indicated lower internal control d  027 At the same time the two groups did not differ from each other with respect to marital status functional limitations and selfreported health nor with respect to cognitive abilities and perceived loneliness These analyses suggest that existing differences are small to marginal in effect size and thus may be indicative of only small selectivity effects For our analyses we used six waves of longitudinal data spanning 18 years As is common in research of old and very old individuals sample attrition primarily due to mortality was considerable Specifically the following numbers of individuals were selected at each measurement occasion at baseline T1 in 1992 n  1215 at T3 in 1994 n  1069 at T6 in 2000 n  505 at T7 in 2003 n  257 at T9 in 2008 n  52 and at T11 in 2011 n  18 Selfesteem was not assessed at T2 T4 T5 T8 or T10 On average T3 took place 203 years SD  052 after T1 T6 799 years SD  041 T7 1107 years SD  045 T9 1538 years SD  082 and T11 1778 years SD  043 respectively Across the six waves the 1215 participants provided 2435 observations M  200 SD  107 More specifically one data point on selfesteem was available for 472 two waves for 435 three waves for 173 four for 108 five for 20 and six for seven participants To quantify longitudinal selectivity we used an effectsize metric that indicates the degree to which individuals of our selected sample who participated in three or more waves n  525 differed from those with fewer data points for details see Lindenberger Singer and Baltes 2002 Total selectivity amounted to 017 SD units where SD refers to that of the 2087 participants from the ALSA sample for selfesteem 018 SD for chronological age 090 SD for time to death 013 SD for gender 003 SD for education 009 SD for marital status 004 SD for comorbidities 012 SD for functional limitations 022 SD for selfrated health 026 SD for perceptual speed 026 SD for perceived control 017 SD for social participation and 007 SD for loneliness This suggests that higher levels of selfesteem at T1 younger age longer time to death better health preserved cognitive functioning higher perceived control more social participation and less loneliness were associated with subsequently lower mortality and higher participation rates among survivors Effects of sample selectivity were primarily due to mortality eg selfesteem 71 of the total effect of 017 SD units rather than to dropout for other reasons The statistical procedures used in our analyses handled this type of nonrandom attrition however we acknowledge that participants with the most longitudinal information represent a positively selected subset of the initial ALSA sample  Measures  Selfesteem The Bachman revision 1970 of Rosenbergs SelfEsteem Scale was used in the ALSA study It comprised 10 items I feel that I have a number of good qualities with four items being reversecoded I think I am no good at all Participants were asked to indicate how often each statement was true on a 5point Likert scale ranging from 1 almost always true to 5 never true Prior to computing individual mean scores we reversecoded the positive items such that higher numbers indicate higher selfesteem Reliability analyses showed satisfactory internal consistency across the entire study Cronbachs alpha  78  Correlates Included in our models was information about participants age date of death gender marital status married vs not married and education indicated by the age people left school from 1 never went to school 2 less than 14 years to 7 18 or more years We also examined resources in the health cognitive selfregulative and social domain as correlates of late life changes in selfesteem see Table 1 for descriptive statistics Graphic Table 1 Health Health was based on three measures Medical conditions were selfreports of the number of current chronic medical conditions from a comprehensive list of 61 eg stroke diabetes arthritis Functional limitations were measured by responses to two mobility items Rosow and Breslau 1966 and to five disability items Nagi 1976 If participants had any degree of difficulty with any of these seven items they received a score of 1 these were summed so that higher scores indicate more functional limitations Selfrated health was based on a oneitem measure on which participants rated their current overall health on a 5point Likertscale  Cognitive We assessed cognitive correlates with the Digit Symbol Substitution subscale of the revised Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Wechsler 1981 for details see Luszcz et al 1997 As a parsimonious measure of psychomotor speed participants were asked to substitute symbols corresponding to numbers from 1 to 9 as rapidly as possible into a randomly ordered array of 93 digits Symbols with corresponding numbers were present throughout the task We included the number of correct substitutions in 90 s  Selfregulative The selfregulative correlates were based on a 12item scale of perceived control from the Expectancy of Control subscale of the Desired Control Measure Luszcz 1998 adapted from Reid and Zeigler 1981 On this measure respondents indicated the extent of their perceived control on a 5point Likert scale ranging from 1 strongly agree to 5 strongly disagree Estimates were based on a sum score of reversedcoded items such that higher scores on the scale illustrate more internal control whereas lower scores illustrate more external control  Social The social resources included two indicators Social participation was based on four items of the Adelaide Activity Profile Clark and Bond 2000 The items assessed the frequency of four sociallife aspects including active social participation eg Having invited other people to ones home Items were rated on a 4point Likertscale with higher scores related to more activity To index lonelinesss we selected one item from the Center of Epidemiological StudiesDepression Scale Radloff 1977 Participants were asked to indicate how often over the past week they had felt lonely Again higher scores on a 4point Likertscale index greater loneliness
