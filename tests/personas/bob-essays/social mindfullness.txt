Although one may not always see it social life often involves choices that make people act in ways that are mindful of others or not We adopt an interdependence theoretical approach to the novel concept of social mindfulness which we conceptualize in terms of otherregarding choices involving both skill to see it eg theory of mind perspective taking and will to do it eg empathic concern prosocial orientation to act mindfully toward another persons control over outcomes We operationalized social mindfulness in a new social decisionmaking paradigm that focuses on leaving or limiting choice options for others that we tested across 7 studies Studies 1a through 1c showed that people with otheroriented mindsets left interdependent others more choice than people with selforiented andor unspecified mindsets Studies 2a and 2b revealed that people developed more favorable judgments of a socially mindful than of a socially unmindful person Study 3 revealed that unknown others with trustworthy vs untrustworthy faces were met with more social mindfulness Study 4 revealed that social mindfulness could be traced in personality by being positively related to HonestyHumility and Agreeableness HEXACO Personality InventoryRevised as well as to Empathy Interpersonal Reactivity Index and a prosocial value orientation SVO Together these studies contribute to explaining how social mindfulness can help people to navigate the social world by aiming to maximize other peoples control over their situational outcomes  Prosocial behavior comes in many flavors and social mindfulness might well be one of them Being socially mindful means to safeguard other peoples control over their own behavioral options in situations of interdependence Recently the concept of mindfulness has become a household term in both clinical and social psychology Mindfulnessbased psychotherapy for instance has shown to be an effective therapy for depression and anxiety disorders eg Chiesa and Serretti 2011 Greeson 2009 Hofmann Sawyer Witt and Oh 2010 and everyday mindfulness as described by Langer 1989 1992 allows for more openness to all the options and alternatives that life has to offereven providing a feeling of empowerment Langer Blank and Chanowitz 1978 However contemporary discussions of mindfulness often overlook the original otherorientedness that is embedded in its Buddhist heritage Black 2011 cf Gergen 2009 Other than the prevalent inward awareness and inner dialogue of modern mindfulness social mindfulness doubles back to its roots by incorporating a benevolent focus on the needs and interests of others General mindfulness starts with paying attention to the little things available to individual awareness social mindfulness starts at a similar basic level In daily life it may sometimes be understood as simply being considerate or being polite An example would be to deliberately not take the last peanut butter cookie from a plate that also holds a couple of chocolate chip cookies Undoubtedly various personal motivations andor preferences may play a role in these kinds of decisions but a readily available reason for refraining from taking the last single cookie is to leave a next person something to choose fromeven if that is only the polite thing to do Key factors in this decision process are to acknowledge the immediate or expected inclusion of someone else in a given situation assess the effect of ones actions on the remaining behavioral options for the other ie interdependence is seen and established and the level of positive regard given to this other Do I really care if uncle John cant choose which cookie he wants as long as he can still have one Subtle but as we argue socially effective actions like leaving or limiting choice options for others requires a process of both perspective taking and empathic concernuncle John might indeed get really upset and not want to play soccer anymore Perspective Taking and Empathic Concern are two of the four domains that Davis 1980 1983 distinguished in the multidimensional concept of empathythe other domains are Fantasy Scale and Personal Distress Separately or in combination these can be used to explain many otheroriented capacities andor tendencies Investigating social mindfulness as a human capacity in which the cognitive component of perspective taking and the affective component of empathic concern work together to signal prosocial intentions offers a practical and concise method to look at an underinvestigated way of how people may balance a need for social inclusion with a need for individual differentiation Brewer 1991 2012 The mindful sequence of to see it ie the perspective of the other person and to do it ie to make choices that leave room for that other requires both skill and will  Socially Mindful Social mindfulness is minding the needs and interests of others in a way that honors the idea that most people like to choose for themselves ie have a certain need for autonomy Deci and Ryan 2012 In terms of interdependence theory eg Kelley and Thibaut 1978 Van Lange and Rusbult 2012 social mindfulness seeks to maximize other peoples control over their own outcomes The socially mindful person makes sure that he or she does not determine or close up situations for others as far as outcomes are concerned In interdependence theory situations that require suspension of immediate personal preferences for the sake of others have been relatively underexposed and in our eyes deserve some attention As mentioned being socially mindful can be as simple as not taking the last peanut butter cookie when there are still other alternatives left Situations like these make a good anchor point for any new measure of social mindfulness Leaving or limiting outcome options for others will therefore constitute the core of the current investigation  Skill and Will Perspective taking is a wellresearched phenomenon eg Batson Early and Salvarani 1997 Ruby and Decety 2004 Neural correlates of this human capacity for instance can be traced back to regions in the medial prefrontal cortex see Amodio and Frith 2006 Related to perspective taking is the concept of theory of mind ToM which enables people to attribute mental statesfor example beliefs intentions desires knowledgeto oneself and to others and to understand that those others have beliefs desires and intentions that are different from ones own eg BaronCohen TagerFlusberg and Cohen 1993 Wimmer and Perner 1983 A basic ToM allows people to know that others have thoughts and feelings in the same way that they have and thus recognizes the others as cognizant and sentient Decety and Batson 2007 An advanced ToM extends this ability to more complex situations in which other peoples perspectives may require some effort to assess Yet another approach to acknowledge the views and feelings of others for example used in personcentered and experiential approaches to psychotherapy is called mentalizing or to become aware of the presence and quality of mental states in self and others eg Allen 2006 Allen Fonagy and Bateman 2008 Building on this extensive body of research we reason that the skill to process other peoples perspective will vary between people and between situations thus laying down the affordance for social mindfulness Skill will set the perimeters but the will to follow up is another issue Early research has shown that especially affective perspective taking connects to a cooperative predisposition and altruistic behavior rather than the ability to take the physical perspective of others eg D W Johnson 1975a 1975b Oswald 1996 Vaish Carpenter and Tomasello 2009 Affective perspective taking is part of the human faculty of empathy mostly related to empathic concern As the capacity to feel for and with others one could expect empathic concern to play an important part in a benevolent approach to the needs and wishes of others and therefore in social mindfulness Motivating factors like these will bring the ability for perspective taking or mentalizing online In other words One needs the skill to assess for the will to address  Interdependence Our conceptualization of social mindfulness is deeply rooted in interdependence theory which emphasizes the role of social orientations such as cooperation and fairness in settings of outcome interdependence Kelley and Thibaut 1978 Social mindfulness as we define and operationalize it extends the focus on outcome interdependence by including the notion that peoples behavioral choices and actions may codetermine the range of possible outcomes for others rather than just the outcome itself cf Kelley et al 2003 Van Lange and Rusbult 2012 In order to investigate these specific instances of interdependence we asked participants in our experiments to imagine being in a dyadic situation in which choices by the one would leave or limit outcome options for the other The operationalization of social mindfulness we discuss in this article was inspired by the penchoice paradigm initially used by Kim and Markus 1999 and further developed by Yamagishi Hashimoto and Schug 2008 see also Hashimoto Li and Yamagishi 2011 In this paradigm people were asked to pick one among five pens that came in two colors The ratio was always two to three pens of the same color or one to four This obviously made one color the majority and the other the minority Both research groups framed their findings in terms of cultural differences but Yamagishi et al 2008 see also Hashimoto et al 2011 argued that instead of being internalized cultural norms which is the point of the Kim and Markus 1999 study preferences for minority versus majority objects were driven by strategies that people follow as what may be called cultural game players Hashimoto et al 2011 p 140 cf Yamagishi et al 2012 They reached this conclusion by noticing that when by themselves or the last to choose and thus without any social pressure most people seemed to prefer the unique option regardless of cultural background Picking the unique object therefore can be seen as the default choice in absence of other extrinsically motivating factors Clearly choosing one object rather than the other can be the result of a strategic choice In order to transpose the penchoice paradigm from unique versus majority choices to a measure of social mindfulness we limited the total number of choice options to three with a standard ratio of one to two eg one blue pen and two green pens Also we repeated similar choices by adding more objects than pens alone Furthermore the setting was always dyadic and the choices socially consequential Choosing one object would remove it for the other person In this set up choosing the object of which there were two would leave the second person something to choose between a blue or a green pen whereas a first choice for the unique object would limit the options because there would only be two identical objects left to choose from In interdependence terms we reasoned that the first persons choice for the doubled object would count as cooperativemindful because it grants the second person control over the same amount and quality of options that were available to the first person A first move for the unique object however removes this control Granting this kind of control may have prosocial motives cf Magee and Langner 2008 because it allows the other to have as much autonomous control over the outcome as the situation will allow This reasoning also taps into selfdetermination theory eg Deci and Ryan 2000 2012 in which autonomy is regarded as a basic need Providing someone with a certain degree of autonomy or at least not taking it away may be perceived as an action that honors the needs and the perspective of the other in other words as an act of social mindfulness In the same realm social value orientations SVOs are conceptually related to social mindfulness In past research three major types of SVO have received most attention including a a prosocial orientation that seeks to enhance own and others outcomes as well as equality in outcomes b an individualistic orientation that seeks to enhance outcomes for self and is largely indifferent to outcomes for another person and c a competitive orientation that seeks to enhance the difference between outcomes for self and other in favor of the self Messick and McClintock 1968 Van Lange Otten De Bruin and Joireman 1997 Thus relative to individualists and competitors prosocials tend to be more otherregarding in that they are more strongly oriented toward helping others and pursuing equality in outcomes Van Lange 1999 expect others to be otherregarding as well Kuhlman Camac and Cunha 1986 and tend to view various interdependence situations in terms of fairness and morality for a review see Balliet Parks and Joireman 2009 Van Lange Schippers and Balliet 2011 Prosocial more than individualistic or competitive orientations therefore can be expected to favor mindful behaviors that safeguard variation in optionsor choicefor others  Research Overview and Hypotheses Social mindfulness seeks to maximize other peoples control over their own outcomes in situations of interdependence this makes it an effective tool for signaling and estimating prosocial intentions To introduce and investigate this novel construct we conducted seven studies with the concomitant goal of testing our new paradigm the Social Mindfulness SoMi paradigm see the General Method section below Social mindfulness makes people leave choice for others out of otherregard Being specifically otheroriented therefore should lead to higher levels of social mindfulness than being selforiented orientation hypothesis For a clear test of concurrent validity we designed an experiment in which we explicitly told our participants to mind either their own or another persons best interest Study 1a Because the wish to gain more information about others might also influence whether to leave someone else a choice or not we planned a replication with the additional instruction that participants would not be informed about the other persons choices Study 1b Next to gaining information choosing behavior may also arise from a selfserving wish to make a favorable impression on others This possible alternative explanation we addressed in a second replication Study 1c Our general argument holds that social mindfulness signals prosocial intentions But for this signal to be functional it must of course also be understood as such We tested this in two studies In a laboratory setting Study 2a looked at how participants would react after witnessing various levels of social mindfulness We expected to find that a socially mindful person would be liked better and trusted more than a socially unmindful person ie someone who leaves the other with little or no choice perceived mindfulness hypothesis In Study 2b we sought to replicate this in an online study using a different and USbased population Because trust and trustworthiness make investing in social relationships a safer bet one of our general expectations was that trust would play a role in social mindfulness not only in the sense that socially mindful individuals will be trusted more than those who are not but also to the extent that the mere appearance of being trustworthy will enhance the chance of being met with social mindfulness In Study 3 we therefore explored whether seeing a strangers trustworthyas opposed to untrustworthyface would be enough to elicit higher levels of social mindfulness trustworthiness hypothesis In Study 4 we sought further validation by tracing social mindfulness in underlying personality structures We expected social mindfulness to be specifically associated with personality factors that are geared toward enhancing or maintaining the relationship with others like HonestyHumility and Agreeableness personality hypothesis We also tested our expectation that Empathy would be associated with Social Mindfulness empathy hypothesis as well as a prosocial value orientation SVO hypothesis
