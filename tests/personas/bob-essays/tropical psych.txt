Grenadians wereless angry at government less fearful and less hopelessinsecure as well as more secure and more sociallytrusting than Colombians and Costa Ricans but less secure and more

appears to have a distinctive ambiance thatinfluences how its citizens collectively feel about and respond to national conditions and events de Rivera 1992de Rivera Kurrien and Olsen 2007 This ambiance has beentermed national emotional climate National emotional climate may be defined as a pervasive pattern of beliefs abouthow angry fearful hopeless secure and trusting most people feel that reflects shared experiences of the economicpolitical and social realities of a country de Rivera 1992 deRivera and Yurtsever 2010 National emotional climate canbe objectively measured and correlated with the personallyheld political views of citizens such as the desire to emigratein response to hopeless conditions and particularly in timesof crises confidence in nonviolent protest against injusticeand willingness to surrender freedom to preserve stabilityTo our knowledge no studies of the national emotional climate of a Caribbean country have been conducted Giventhe political and economic history of Grenada and its current difficulties we believed that such a study would shedlight on Grenadas collectively held beliefs and their connection to the personal political inclinations of individualGrenadian citizensThe purpose of this study was threefold First we wantedto delineate the national emotional climate of GrenadaSecond we wanted to examine the relationship betweenGrenadas national emotional climate to three personallyheld political views desire to emigrate confidence in nonviolent protest and willingness to surrender freedom Therelationship between these variables has been establishedin previous crossnational research de Rivera and Yurtsever2010 Third we wanted to compare Grenadas nationalemotional climate to that of selected countries adjoiningthe Caribbean for which archival data was convenientlyavailable namely Colombia Costa Rica and the UnitedStatesMethodDesign and AnalysesThe design of the study was strictly correlational Pearsonproductmoment correlation coefficients were calculatedfor the five national emotional climate scale scores and ratings for the three items on personal political views as well aswith age and ratings of current happiness overall happinessand social desirability Chisquare tests were used to evaluatedifferences in scores on the five national emotional climatescales based on gender and socioeconomic status Separatestepwise regression analyses were performed with ratingsfor each political view as a distinct criterion and the five national emotional climate scale scores as predictors Our aimwas to discern the unique contribution of each dimensionof national emotional climate to a particular political viewheld by individual Grenadians Finally raw score means forthe five national emotional climate scales for Grenadiansand archival national emotional climate scale score meansfor Colombian Costa Rican and US samples were standardised to permit a qualitative crossnational comparisonof national emotional climate Noteworthy differences between country samples on standardised national emotionalclimate scale score means were operationalised as more thanonehalf of a standard score difference ie azscore

components of emotional climate de Riveraand Yurtsever 2010 Anger at Government four items Fearthree items HopelessInsecurity four items Securityfour items and Social Trust five items These five scalesrepresent the underlying dimensions of national emotionalclimate that were derived from an exploratory factor analysis of 1699 participants from 10 countries and have beenused in previous research on national emotional climatede Rivera and Yurtsever 2010 and cultures of peace deRivera et al 2007 Adhering to the fivefactor structureof national emotional climate permitted us to make

nonviolent methods such as voting peaceful protests strikes that do not destroy propertycan increase justice in this society Willingness to surrender freedom was gauged by the item Are you willing to giveup some freedom so that a strong leader can make thingsbetter Each of these items has been used in prior researchas an index of politically related personal beliefs de Riveraet al 2010 We dispersed the three items on political viewsamong the 24 items that comprised the measure of nationalemotional climateControl variablesTo determine whether responses to thefive scales of national emotional climate and three itemson personal political views were confounded we administered two moodrelated items and one item on social desirability de Rivera et al 2010 One of the moodrelateditems inquired about participants current level of happiness whereas the other asked about their level of overall lifehappiness The social desirability item probed how pressured participants feel in responding as others want Moodand social desirability items required participants to providea rating with a 7point Likert scale 1no7absolutelyWe embedded the three items on mood and social desirability along with two categorical items that inquired aboutgender and socioeconomic status and one openended itemon age among the 24 items that measured national emotional climateTABLE

securityDiscussionIn reflecting on their fellow citizens predominant experience of the economy politics and society Grenadian participants identified widespread moderate frustration withgovernment leaders and policies coupled with mixed feelings of resignation and optimism about current and futureconditions affecting the country They reported little pervasive apprehension about public discourse and a broadbasedtendency to respect and expect cooperation from their fellow citizens Grenadians did not manifest a pattern of collectively held beliefs that would likely occasion personal intentions to leave the country or to abandon peaceful methodsof working toward social changeThese findings come as no surprise As in manyCaribbean countries Grenada has already witnessed a largenumber of young people depart the island With more than100000 people residing in Grenada estimates are that atleast that number of Grenadians have emigrated elsewherein the Caribbean and at least that number again have settledin firstworld countries CIA World Factbook 2013 Steele2003 The economy has been shackled with debt from rebuilding the island in the wake of hurricanes Ivan and Emilynearly a decade ago and has shown vulnerability since thento episodic regional and global economic declines HoweverGrenada has viable tourism manufacturing and agriculturesectors that have potential for growth and job creation Politically Grenada has enjoyed an unbroken period free ofpolitical violence since 1983 Seaga 2009 The country issufficiently stable to have recently commuted the sentencesof several members of the Grenada 17 who were convictedof the 1983 coup that overthrew and murdered then PrimeMinister Maurice Bishop Early in 2013 Grenadians participated in a contentious national election in which theNational Democratic Congress was resoundingly defeateddue to widespread dissatisfaction with the partys leadersin failing to chart a course for economic recovery and todemonstrate political inclusiveness and transparency in itsapproach to governance Caribbean News Now 2013aNotwithstanding these mixed economic and political realities Grenadian citizens whether at home or in the Grenadian diaspora appeared highly engaged in the life of theircountry with electoral observation missions from the Organisation of American States and CARICOM reporting85 total voter turnout and both the campaign and election conducted peacefully Caribbean News Now 2013bThus there is impressionistic historical and contemporaryevidence to support our finding of an association betweenthe collective beliefs about Grenada and the political views ofindividual Grenadians while moderate frustration towardgovernment leaders and policies may lead some Grenadiansto contemplate leaving the island when paired with cautiousoptimism about the Grenadas future may modulate angerat government offer an incentive for citizens to stay put andincrease engagement in lawful political change This possibility underscores the need for sophisticated research designs to disentangle the complex interaction between multiple dimensions of national emotional climate and personalpolitical beliefs both in Grenada and elsewhereThe national emotional climate of Grenada is generallymore positive than that of Colombia and Costa Rica butsomewhat less favourable than that of the United StatesEconomic development has been tentatively linked to apositive national emotional climate de Rivera 1992 deRivera and Yurtsever 2010 However this interpretation cannot account for the differences in national emotional climate observed between Grenada and both Colombia andCosta Rica all of which share developing country statusand are uppermiddle income countries CIA World Factbook 2013 World Bank 2013 Nor does it explain thesimilarity in national emotional climate between Grenadaand the United States which is a highincome countryCIA World Factbook 2013 World Bank 2013 Likewisedemographic homogeneity and the cultural dimension ofindividualcollectivism fall short of clarifying the similarities and differences in national emotional climate betweenGrenada and selected countries that adjoin the CaribbeanWhile it is reasonable to assert that Grenada Colombia andCosta Rica are more demographically homogeneous andculturally collectivistic than the United States the countrymeans for national emotional climate scale scores do notadhere to this patternAn alternative consideration in making sense of our findings may lie in how the cultural milieu of the four countries covary Grenada and the United States share an Anglocentric culture whereas Colombian and Costa Rican cultureis primarily Latin Whether these two cultures contribute tovarious dimensions of national emotional climate and howthey mediate the similarities and differences between thefour countries sampled are topics worthy of future researchFurthermore our findings for Grenada departed markedlyfrom those of the 10 countries that de Rivera and Yurtsever 2010 compared In their study desire to emigratewas predicted by all national emotional climate scales except for social trust confidence in nonviolent protest bysocial trust and willingness to surrender freedom by fearand social trust Thus we hereby offer a tentative hypothesis that national emotional climate which reflects a set ofinterwoven collective beliefs born of shared economic political and social experiences may be influenced by moreenduring and foundational normative systems de Rivera1992 The work of Ronald Ingelhart and Wayne Baker aswell as that of Michael Harris Bond seem highly germanehere Ingelhart and Baker 2000 extracted two bipolar dimensions from their World Values Survey namely authorityie traditional  secularrational and values ie survival selfexpression These dimensions can be crossed to locate countries in a fourcelled matrix with which to understand how culture can influence how countries responseJOURNAL OF TROPICAL PSYCHOLOGY 5Michael J Stevens Justina E Aire and Beverly E Stevensto economic and political challenges Similarly Bond et al2004 identified two social axioms or culturelevel beliefsthat act as recipes for living which can be transformed intoa fourfold typology dynamic externality ie conservativesocial hierarchies and societal cynicism ie widespreadmistrust of social systems This typology also offers anattractive conceptual framework for better understandingthe observed crossnational variation in national emotionalclimate Obviously further research is needed to identify measure and conceptually integrate cultural and othergrouplevel variables about which relatively little is knownGriffith 2001 that contribute to Grenadas national emotional climate per se and in relation to its neighboursFuture regional investigations of national emotional climate and personal political views should gather data on andcompare larger more representative samples from Grenadaand other understudied Caribbean countries In additionthese studies should establish the crossnational equivalenceof measures of national emotional climate and personal political views at both the item and
