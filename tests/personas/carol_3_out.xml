<rank>0.254613</rank><id>11</id><content>My Parents    I think that my parents are very different from each other. They never agree on a point. They always have different opinions, even on very simple issues. They argue all the time and I think this is their secret formula for staying married for such a long time. Arguing is a way of talking to each other and talking enables couples to know and understand each other. As a result, my parents are still together although they have more differences than similarities.    Their differences start with their appearances. My father is dark, very tall and of medium weight. On the other hand, my mother is not so tall; she is a little fat, and she has brown hair and a fair complexion. They dont look similar at all. However, they look nice together.    In addition, their personalities are very different. My mother is open-minded; she doesnt stick to one idea. She listens to other people and changes her mind if it is necessary. My father, on the other hand, is very stubborn. If he has an opinion, he refuses to change it. I think they have only one personality trait in common: they are both very giving to my sister and me.    Their tastes in life are different too. My father likes football and basketball games, while mother likes TV serials and movies. My father likes listening to music loudly and this annoys my mother.    They are very different but they have my sister and me in common. They love each other and us after so many years together. Some people say opposites attract.  I think it is true.</content></resource>

<rank>0.177966</rank><id>9</id><content>MY PARENTS    People have different characteristics, so it is very difficult for couples to continue a marriage. A couple like my parents who have different characteristics but who know how to complement each other is successful at continuing their marriage.    If I didnt know my own parents, I couldnt believe that two such different people could live together very happily. They differ from each other in countless aspects. For example, their physical appearance is the clearest evidence for their difference. My father is a tall and thin man. He has big hands and long arms. Also my father is blonde, while my mother is quite dark. My mother is a short woman. She is nearly 15 cm. shorter than my father. Her hands are so small that her two hands are still smaller than my fathers one hand. Moreover, my mother is a bit fat. I can say that she fits the image of the typical Turkish woman.    The obvious difference in their personality is that while my mother is quite talkative, even gregarious, my father isnt keen on talking too much. My father prefers to listen to people and doesnt like making too many comments. It doesnt mean that he doesnt like talking, but he talks when it is necessary. Also he is very open-minded and never asks me too many questions about my decisions, my activities. On the other hand, my mum asks everything, what I did, where I was and with whom, why I was there she interferes with everything and is curious. Perhaps, it results from her worries about me but sometimes it is quite annoying. For example, while I am on my way to Istanbul, she calls me constantly. She knows the mobile phone is turned off but she still calls. In contrast to her, my father is carefree. He waits until I call them. I love this trait of his because it makes me feel free.    As I said before, they are my parents and are quite different. But somehow they achieve complementing and understanding each other. In my opinion, it is enough to be a happy pair.</content></resource>

<rank>0.146341</rank><id>10</id><content>My Parents    My mother and my father got married in 1984 and since that time they have been living together, and they are really happy. I envy them their happiness and their relationship. One day if I get married, I want to be like them. They are very similar in some ways such as physical appearance, personality and tastes in life. I believe that because of these similarities they get on very well.    Firstly, they are both tall. They are not of the same height but my mother is tall for a woman and my father is also tall for a man according to Turkish standards. They have fair skin although my mother is a bit darker than my father. Also they are similar in their body build. They are not fat but they arent thin either. The only difference in their physical difference is the color of their eyes. My father has green eyes whereas my mother has dark brown eyes.    They have some similarities in their personality too. Surprisingly, they get angry at the same time at the same things. When one of them starts to shout at my sister or me the other one carries on. I believe that they think about the same things too, so they can do this. They are also both easy-going. I can explain or share my ideas and my aims to them very easily. I am never afraid of them, because they never frighten me. But in some conditions, of course, they are different from each other. We are like friends with my mother. I share all of my secrets with her and she helps me, like a close friend. On the other hand, my father is a bit distant but I think that is normal because I am a girl. I am sure if I told him my secrets he would become angry. In general, I get on well with both of them.    In addition to these, they have the same goals. First of all, their only wishes are about my sister and me. They want us to be healthy, successful and happy. They also have some dreams. After my sister and I get married they want to have a small house in a small seaside town. They also want to travel the world. They are interested in the same things too. They like the same kind of music, movies and sports. For example, my mother watches football matches with my father and he in turn goes shopping with her. They get on very well; I dont remember a thing which they think differently about.    In conclusion, they are very similar in lots of ways. Because of these, they are a perfect couple. I am very proud to have parents like them. They have brought me up in a happy home. In the future I want to do the same thing for my child, and make him as happy as I am.</content></resource>
