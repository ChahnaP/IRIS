    There are many ways for people to be happy. Some people are happy maintaining successful business affairs, some of them are happy having big amounts of money and many of them are happy bringing up their children. In my opinion, children are the ultimate bliss in our lives and if I reach the suitable age for marriage; I really want to have at least two children. Not only me but also many people plan to have children of their own   as they    add beauty to our lives.
     
    To begin with, children bring happiness and meaning to your life. Your child belongs to you, and you belong to    him. You know he is a piece of you. If you are a mother, you can easily consider how important it is to see a part of you alive, especially after carrying him for nine months inside you. Watching them, we naturally become happy and begin   to laugh with them with a great love. They are the most beautiful, the best and the most meaningful part of life for us.
     
    Then, we can say that they are our insurance for our old age. It is commonplace to see many old people without children living lonely or unhappy lives in poverty. Those people are the people who have not chosen     to have children or those who have always wanted but not had the chance to have them. There are many famous people like that such as Emel Sayin and our prime minister and his wife, Rahsan and Bulent Ecevit.  We notice that they are very lonely and unhappy now without any children. When we have children, we do not get anxious about our life to continue and our belongings to get wasted. We know that our generation will continue too, by means of our children.
     
    To sum up, many people   are happy to have children and many of them are going to be happy to have them as children not only bring happiness and meaning to our lives and are our insurance but they also help   our generation to continue. They mean so much for us as well since they are worth everything in life.

    Most people want to get married and have children. Perhaps they want to leave a trace or offspring after them, so that they become somehow “immortal”. And it is commonly said that children are the ultimate bliss in our lives. Although many people agree with this statement, to my mind, it is not true.
     
    Firstly, it is always claimed that having children brings happiness and meaning to one’s life. To raise them well becomes an ideal for parents. However, I think that although this may be true, children are also a financial and psychological burden for parents. To have children is to have responsibility. Parents spend all their time and money on their children, for their education, clothing and other needs, and do not have much time or money left for themselves.
     
    Secondly, many people assert that it is in human nature to procreate and to see a part of them continue to live. However, I do not believe that it is necessarily instinctive. There are a lot of people who do not have any children and they do not have a tendency to see a part of them continue to live. I think having children for this reason is very old-fashioned. We can have other accomplishments in life for our name or fame continue.
     
    Finally, it is commonly stated that children are our insurance for our old age and that when we get older they will take care of us. Although there are many people who think so, I believe that they are no guarantee against loneliness in old age. Usually children, whether they are married or not, leave their homes. Besides, it is very selfish to have children for insurance. If you have a child, you have to accept the fact that he/she is also an individual and has his/her own needs, and will eventually have his/her own life separate from yours.
     
    To sum up, for most people it might be the biggest happiness to have children. However, I firmly believe that to have children is not everything in life. People can also live full and accomplished lives without children.

              In life, people pass through different phases. They are born into a family, and then they grow up and reach puberty. After puberty, they are considered adults. At this time, the sociological burden becomes heavier and new responsibilities are added to a person’s burden. Graduating from a good university, finding a job, getting married and having children are some of these expectations. Most people consider these expectations especially having children reasonable and a source of happiness. However, it is my opinion that children are far away from being the ultimate bliss in our lives; on the contrary, they bring about more responsibilities and restrictions.
     
            Some people claim that children bring happiness and meaning to one’s life. But people also have aims, pleasures and hobbies that contribute to their happiness. Therefore, we do not need children to achieve happiness. Also, in my opinion, children are a burden for the family. Once you give birth to babies, you must do everything to raise them. You must pay for new clothes, nannies, expensive schools, etc. Since you spend all your money on your children, you do not have enough financial resources to do something for yourself.
     
            Children restrict the parents. Since you are always busy with your kids and their problems, you do not have enough time to be with your friends or to do things that give pleasure to you. For instance, you cannot always go out with your spouse or you cannot easily go to the theater, opera or ballet because children are not allowed. If you    are tired or depressed, you will not have the right to spend time alone because you are a parent.
     
            It has been maintained that procreation is instinctive and seeing a part of us continue to live is important. However, it is my contention that bringing children to a world full of uncertainty and danger just to satisfy our own desires is a bit selfish. Today there are lots of dangerous events in the world and we do not know what will happen      in the future. A war that will destroy most of the world, a nuclear bomb, threat of global warming and radiation are some possible things that our new generation will have to cope with.
     
            Some people advocate that   children are our insurance for our old age. This idea might be true in traditional families, but there are no more traditional families today. Now you rear children with lots of difficulty, and then they   get married and leave you. I mean  kids are no guarantee against loneliness.
     
            In conclusion, having children brings lots of responsibilities, restrictions and problems. Also bringing children to a world that is full of chaos will also be bad and depressing for kids. In my opinion, having children     of our own is not necessary for our happiness.

    “It is the highest and the holiest emotion to experience motherhood or fatherhood. Everybody has a child in his own image.” All of these are vain words and pink dreams. Having children is not as easy as those cliché words or beliefs. Therefore, people should not have children.
     
    First of all, people cannot predict their own future or know what will happen tomorrow. The world is full of disasters such as wars, pollution, famine, drought, starvation, natural disasters and diseases. For example, count to 3. 1,2,3: now almost 2.5 children are born and 3 children died because of starvation in Africa. Of course, nobody wants to have children in these conditions. We have to live in this dirty world but why do we make our children live in there too? So it is just a big mistake to have children.
     
    Further more, it is a very heavy psychological and physical burden to have children. A mother carries her baby in her womb for nine months and 10 days and then the baby torments her during and after the birth. There is no peace, no silence or no sleep at home. On the other hand, the father has to work hard and earn more money because the baby comes with his expenses, not his “rizk.” Also the baby limits his parents’ achievements; they cannot go everywhere they want to or do the things they wish to. A baby requires more responsibility because parents should give him a good life. If they don't, they have account for every problem he has.
     
    It is claimed that people should have children so that they will not be lonely when they are old. Their children will take care of them and they will feel safe. A child is the only person whom you can trust and with whom share every secret. These are big lies too. People believe in these lies and deceive themselves. They console themselves because they want to diminish the pains, regrets and torments that children give them. It is much better not to have any children than try to deceive oneself and avoid seeing the truth of having children who cause one a lot of pain and suffering.
     
    To sum up, having children is a decision that has no going back. We know the difficulties the world has in store for us and we also know that children present a psychological and physical burden to their parents. Knowing these, it is very selfish to have children.

    Humankind can’t continue their lives without desires. If one wants to be happy, surely, he has to discover his best desires that provide him a happy life. Some of these desires that help to continue our lives can be acceptance in our relationships, a good family life and strong social relations. Trying to satisfy these desires has a great meaning to achieve happiness for me.
     
    To start with, however embarrassed I am about this desire of mine, I have an obsession to expect people to accept my thoughts and manners in every situation. Yes, this is not a good characteristic and sometimes makes me an antipathic person but trying to be accepted by someone can give you happiness, too. Besides, if you can manage to make someone love you knowing and accepting all about you, I think that is the absolute happiness.
     
    Furthermore, it seems to me that family is the basic source of happiness. Certainly, I can’t always be a good guy and sometimes I make them upset but I can’t stand seeing them upset. Therefore, I try to do whatever necessary to make them happy. Consequently, when I see happy family faces, I feel deeply happy.
     
    Thirdly, to have friends is one of the most meaningful aspects of life. I believe that one should have three very warm friends at least. For example, I can’t bear loneliness and if I couldn’t share all my heart with these warm friends, I believe that I could never be happy. As a consequence, if you feel like me, it will be worth improving your close relationships in order to be happy.
     
    To recap, humankind has a short life but he is given a lot of desires to be happy. Moreover, if one wants to discover the meaning of his short life, he should look for it in desires. Whether he finds it or not, he will taste happiness just by looking for it.

    “Parents”. I consider mine as my flat mates these days because we do not spend much time together. We are four people living in a house together but we even eat our dinners separately because everybody comes home at different times and we are busy all the time. What I remember from the old days is my two grown up flat mates are two different characters so I have no idea why they still live together.

    They are pretty much the same in physical appearance.  They both have fair complexions which is typical of Caucasians. They should be thin if we consider this “type” but they are not. Actually they were but I can’t remember those days.

     They have different personalities. My father is moody and pretty much aggressive just like me. He has obsessions, like everything should be perfect. On the other hand, my mother never cares about what she is doing and she has what we will call the patience of a saint. Whenever my father gets angry and starts shouting, my mother goes “Ergun, why are you shouting?” with a very calm voice.

     What they really can’t get along about is their tastes in life. My mother loves spending money. She can spend her whole day going around the stores shopping while my father is sitting at home reading newspapers and books or watching documentaries on TV.

     Although my parents are very different from each other, they came to an agreement and that is not being a parent for me any more. They never worry about me when I am late and they never interfere in my choices. I think from now on they will work on my brother, my poor little brother.

    People have different characteristics, so it is very difficult for couples to continue a marriage. A couple like my parents who have different characteristics but who know how to complement each other is successful at continuing their marriage.
     
    If I didn’t know my own parents, I couldn’t believe that two such different people could live together very happily. They differ from each other in countless aspects. For example, their physical appearance is the clearest evidence for their difference. My father is a tall and thin man. He has big hands and long arms. Also my father is blonde, while my mother is quite dark. My mother is a short woman. She is nearly 15 cm. shorter than my father. Her hands are so small that her two hands are still smaller than my father’s one hand. Moreover, my mother is a bit fat. I can say that she fits the image of the typical Turkish woman.
     
    The obvious difference in their personality is that while my mother is quite talkative, even gregarious, my father isn’t keen on talking too much. My father prefers to listen to people and doesn’t like making too many comments. It doesn’t mean that he doesn’t like talking, but he talks when it is necessary. Also he is very open-minded and never asks me too many questions about my decisions, my activities. On the other hand, my mum asks everything, what I did, where I was and with whom, why I was there… she interferes with everything and is curious. Perhaps, it results from her worries about me but sometimes it is quite annoying. For example, while I am on my way to Istanbul, she calls me constantly. She knows the mobile phone is turned off but she still calls. In contrast to her, my father is carefree. He waits until I call them. I love this trait of his because it makes me feel free.
     
    As I said before, they are my parents and are quite different. But somehow they achieve complementing and understanding each other. In my opinion, it is enough to be a happy pair.

    My mother and my father got married in 1984 and since that time they have been living together, and they are really happy. I envy them their happiness and their relationship. One day if I get married, I want to be like them. They are very similar in some ways such as physical appearance, personality and tastes in life. I believe that because of these similarities they get on very well.
     
    Firstly, they are both tall. They are not of the same height but my mother is tall for a woman and my father is also tall for a man according to Turkish standards. They have fair skin although my mother is a bit darker than my father. Also they are similar in their body build. They are not fat but they aren’t thin either. The only difference in their physical difference is the color of their eyes. My father has green eyes whereas my mother has dark brown eyes.
     
    They have some similarities in their personality too. Surprisingly, they get angry at the same time at the same things. When one of them starts to shout at my sister or me the other one carries on. I believe that they think about the same things too, so they can do this. They are also both easy-going. I can explain or share my ideas and my aims to them very easily. I am never afraid of them, because they never frighten me. But in some conditions, of course, they are different from each other. We are like friends with my mother. I share all of my secrets with her and she helps me, like a close friend. On the other hand, my father is a bit distant but I think that is normal because I am a girl. I am sure if I told him my secrets he would become angry. In general, I get on well with both of them.
     
    In addition to these, they have the same goals. First of all, their only wishes are about my sister and me. They want us to be healthy, successful and happy. They also have some dreams. After my sister and I get married they want to have a small house in a small seaside town. They also want to travel the world. They are interested in the same things too. They like the same kind of music, movies and sports. For example, my mother watches football matches with my father and he in turn goes shopping with her. They get on very well; I don’t remember a thing which they think differently about.
     
    In conclusion, they are very similar in lots of ways. Because of these, they are a perfect couple. I am very proud to have parents like them. They have brought me up in a happy home. In the future I want to do the same thing for my child, and make him as happy as I am.

    I think that my parents are very different from each other. They never agree on a point. They always have different opinions, even on very simple issues. They argue all the time and I think this is their secret formula for staying married for such a long time. Arguing is a way of talking to each other and talking enables couples to know and understand each other. As a result, my parents are still together although they have more differences than similarities.
     
    Their differences start with their appearances. My father is dark, very tall and of medium weight. On the other hand, my mother is not so tall; she is a little fat, and she has brown hair and a fair complexion. They don’t look similar at all. However, they look nice together.
     
    In addition, their personalities are very different. My mother is open-minded; she doesn’t stick to one idea. She listens to other people and changes her mind if it is necessary. My father, on the other hand, is very stubborn. If he has an opinion, he refuses to change it. I think they have only one personality trait in common: they are both very giving to my sister and me.
     
    Their tastes in life are different too. My father likes football and basketball games, while mother likes TV serials and movies. My father likes listening to music loudly and this annoys my mother.
     
    They are very different but they have my sister and me in common. They love each other and us after so many years together. Some people say ‘opposites attract’.  I think it is true.
