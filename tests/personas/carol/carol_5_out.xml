Most people want to get married and have children. Perhaps they want to leave a trace or offspring after them, so that they become somehow &#x201C;immortal&#x201D;. And it is commonly said that children are the ultimate bliss in our lives. Although many people agree with this statement, to my mind, it is not true.    Firstly, it is always claimed that having children brings happiness and meaning to one&#x2019;s life. To raise them well becomes an ideal for parents. However, I think that although this may be true, children are also a financial and psychological burden for parents. To have children is to have responsibility. Parents spend all their time and money on their children, for their education, clothing and other needs, and do not have much time or money left for themselves.    Secondly, many people assert that it is in human nature to procreate and to see a part of them continue to live. However, I do not believe that it is necessarily instinctive. There are a lot of people who do not have any children and they do not have a tendency to see a part of them continue to live. I think having children for this reason is very old-fashioned. We can have other accomplishments in life for our name or fame continue.    Finally, it is commonly stated that children are our insurance for our old age and that when we get older they will take care of us. Although there are many people who think so, I believe that they are no guarantee against loneliness in old age. Usually children, whether they are married or not, leave their homes. Besides, it is very selfish to have children for insurance. If you have a child, you have to accept the fact that he/she is also an individual and has his/her own needs, and will eventually have his/her own life separate from yours.    To sum up, for most people it might be the biggest happiness to have children. However, I firmly believe that to have children is not everything in life. People can also live full and accomplished lives without children.</content></resource><resource><rank>0.669048</rank><id>5</id><content> CHILDREN     It is the highest and the holiest emotion to experience motherhood or fatherhood  Everybody has a child in his own image   All of these are vain words and pink dreams  Having children is not as easy as those clich  words or beliefs  Therefore  people should not have children            First of all  people cannot predict their own future or know what will happen tomorrow  The world is full of disasters such as wars  pollution  famine  drought  starvation  natural disasters and diseases  For example  count to 3  1 2 3  now almost 2 5 children are born and 3 children died because of starvation in Africa  Of course  nobody wants to have children in these conditions  We have to live in this dirty world but why do we make our children live in there too  So it is just a big mistake to have children            Further more  it is a very heavy psychological and physical burden to have children  A mother carries her baby in her womb for nine months and 10 days and then the baby torments her during and after the birth  There is no peace  no silence or no sleep at home  On the other hand  the father has to work hard and earn more money because the baby comes with his expenses  not his  rizk   Also the baby limits his parents  achievements  they cannot go everywhere they want to or do the things they wish to  A baby requires more responsibility because parents should give him a good life  If they don t  they have account for every problem he has            It is claimed that people should have children so that they will not be lonely when they are old  Their children will take care of them and they will feel safe  A child is the only person whom you can trust and with whom share every secret  These are big lies too  People believe in these lies and deceive themselves  They console themselves because they want to diminish the pains  regrets and torments that children give them  It is much better not to have any children than try to deceive oneself and avoid seeing the truth of having children who cause one a lot of pain and suffering            To sum up  having children is a decision that has no going back  We know the difficulties the world has in store for us and we also know that children present a psychological and physical burden to their parents  Knowing these  it is very selfish to have children</content></resource><resource><rank>0.629787</rank><id>4</id><content>NEW RESTRICTIONS              In life, people pass through different phases. They are born into a family, and then they grow up and reach puberty. After puberty, they are considered adults. At this time, the sociological burden becomes heavier and new responsibilities are added to a person&#x2019;s burden. Graduating from a good university, finding a job, getting married and having children are some of these expectations. Most people consider these expectations especially having children reasonable and a source of happiness. However, it is my opinion that children are far away from being the ultimate bliss in our lives; on the contrary, they bring about more responsibilities and restrictions.            Some people claim that children bring happiness and meaning to one&#x2019;s life. But people also have aims, pleasures and hobbies that contribute to their happiness. Therefore, we do not need children to achieve happiness. Also, in my opinion, children are a burden for the family. Once you give birth to babies, you must do everything to raise them. You must pay for new clothes, nannies, expensive schools, etc. Since you spend all your money on your children, you do not have enough financial resources to do something for yourself.            Children restrict the parents. Since you are always busy with your kids and their problems, you do not have enough time to be with your friends or to do things that give pleasure to you. For instance, you cannot always go out with your spouse or you cannot easily go to the theater, opera or ballet because children are not allowed. If you    are tired or depressed, you will not have the right to spend time alone because you are a parent.            It has been maintained that procreation is instinctive and seeing a part of us continue to live is important. However, it is my contention that bringing children to a world full of uncertainty and danger just to satisfy our own desires is a bit selfish. Today there are lots of dangerous events in the world and we do not know what will happen      in the future. A war that will destroy most of the world, a nuclear bomb, threat of global warming and radiation are some possible things that our new generation will have to cope with.            Some people advocate that   children are our insurance for our old age. This idea might be true in traditional families, but there are no more traditional families today. Now you rear children with lots of difficulty, and then they   get married and leave you. I mean  kids are no guarantee against loneliness.            In conclusion, having children brings lots of responsibilities, restrictions and problems. Also bringing children to a world that is full of chaos will also be bad and depressing for kids. In my opinion, having children     of our own is not necessary for our happiness.</content></resource></resourceList><clientID>1</clientID></parameters>
