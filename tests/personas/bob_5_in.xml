with prevention states undermining creative insight and promotion states facilitating it We tested whether similar effects occur as a result of priming goal standards related to prevention focus ought standards versus promotion focus ideal standards A pilot study established that the importance placed on ought versus ideal selfstandards predicted the desire to be creative with the strongest creativity orientation observed among participants who placed a high value on achieving goals related to ideal standards and a low value on achieving goals related to ought standards Two experiments then demonstrated that goal priming influenced the novelty of responses to a word association task with activation of ought standards decreasing and activation of ideal evaluative standards increasing novelty Study 2 revealed that the influence of goal priming was eliminated when participants were put under time pressure suggesting that this manipulation exerted influence on response novelty through a controlled as opposed to spontaneous process  People are most creative when they are intrinsically motivated valuing creativity for its own sake Azzam 2009 Cskszentmihlyi 1999 Paris et al 2006 This seems to suggest that one way to promote creativity is to teach people to value it but the literature on goal pursuits suggests that there is reason to question such a straightforward prediction Goals can take different forms leading to different results In the current studies we considered two distinct ways of approaching creative pursuits that are derived from Higgins selfdiscrepancy theory 1987 and his later 1998 regulatory focus model We propose that an intrinsic interest in creativity is beneficial when people are motivated to be creative as an expression of their hopes and ideals whereas intrinsic interest is harmful when it is associated with a sense of duty or obligation  SelfGuides and Regulatory Focus Interest in creativity is just one of many actions that can be shaped through normal socialization Early in normal development much of socialization is focused toward bringing order and selfcontrol to a childs life Children are potty trained learn to say please and thank you to tell the truth not to steal and so on As children enter adolescence and move beyond they learn progressively more complex and abstract codes of conduct Higgins 1987 termed the internalized evaluative standards that guide such civilized actions ought selfguides These are representations of the attributes that young actors learn they should possess out of a sense of duty obligation and social responsibility But not all actions are dictated by duty Through normal socialization children also develop the values that guide their aspirational pursuits In Higgins model the internalized standards that guide these actions are termed ideal selfguides These are representations of attributes that are not dictated so much by obligation or responsibility as by the actors own hopes wishes and personal ambition Higgins 1998 proposed that these two internalized standards are tied to two distinct motivational orientations Because duty and responsibility are typically taught through the delivery and threat of punishment ought selfguides lead individuals to adopt a prevention focus Prevention focus is characterized by the pursuit of safety and avoidance of unwanted outcomes A much different dynamic is associated with ideal selfguides Because hopes and aspirations are typically cultivated through the delivery and promise of praise and admiration ideal selfguides lead individuals to adopt a promotion focus Promotion focus is characterized by a desire to seek and attain positive outcomes Importantly people differ in their overall concern for achieving their ideals versus living up to their obligations and so they differ in their general tendencies toward promotion and prevention see Higgins 1998 However all individuals should be motivated to some extent by a mix of both ought and ideal selfguides As a result situations that momentarily activate interest in ought fulfillment can orient a person toward prevention focus whereas situations that momentarily activate interest in ideal attainment can orient a person toward promotion focus  Regulatory Focus and Creativity To our knowledge research has not directly linked selfguide activation to creative pursuits Such work is important however as it might more fully inform educators on the best way to cultivate intrinsic creativity motivation Should one teach creativity as an ideal that individuals should strive to achieve or as a duty that one has a responsibility to exhibit Although there is a paucity of work addressing this specific question considerable attention has been given to the effect of promotion versus prevention focus on creativity In general individuals high in promotion focus have been shown to engage in more flexible and creative thinking whereas those high in prevention focus have been shown to be lower on these dimensions eg Frster and Dannenberg 2010 Friedman and Frster 2001 2002 Studies also suggest that situations that activate promotionfocused states result in greater creativity than situations that activate preventionfocused states typically induced by procedures that focus attention on achieving positive outcomes Baas De Dreu and Nijstad 2008 Frster and Dannenberg 2010 Friedman and Frster 2001 2002 Researchers have also manipulated regulatory focus by directly framing the incentives for a creativity task or by indirectly priming approach versus avoidance mindsets An example of direct goal priming can be found in Lam and Chiu 2002 They instructed participants taking a creative task to imagine that their own good performance would increase chances of achieving a positive outcome being admitted to a professional school or avoiding a negative outcome being rejected by a professional school An example of indirect goal priming can be found in a series of studies by Friedman and Frster 2001 2005 They manipulated a regulatory focus state through use of a maze task Participants were instructed to find a solution to a maze that would help a mouse either find cheese promotion focus or avoid a predator prevention focus Combined the literature relying on such methods suggests that promotion focus bolsters creative thought creative idea generation and improves memory search for novel responses whereas prevention focuses works against these effects  Creativity SelfGuides Research on regulatory focus provides a strong basis for hypothesizing links between motivational systems and creative output but it does not speak directly to an issue that might be of concern to many educators Specifically how should creativity be linked to ones selfconcept and what broad goal orientations will promote creative pursuits We suggest that creativity is best internalized as an ideal as this should trigger a promotion regulatory focus that is compatible with this goal In contrast if creativity is internalized as an ought then this should trigger a prevention regulatory focus that is incompatible with this goal We tested this logic in an initial pilot study and two experiments The pilot study first tested for the presence of a correlational link between the chronic concerns for ideal versus ought selfguides and the desire to be creative The two experimental studies then adapted a new priming procedure to activate ought versus ideal selfguides to determine whether this resulted in corresponding shifts in creative output  Pilot Study  Method Participants were 48 college students n  33 women who completed three measures as part of pretesting for a separate study The first two measures assessed the importance of ought and ideal pursuits and the third measured the importance of creativity Goal orientation was measured for both ought and ideal pursuits by having participants rate the importance of attributes associated with each pursuit With respect to ought standards participants listed three traits that they should possess in the future if they live up to their personal feelings of obligation and duty With respect to ideal standards participants listed three traits that they will possess in the future if they live up to their personal ideals Participants then rated the set of ought and ideal pursuits in overall importance on a scale from 0 not at all important to 6 extremely important and these two ratings became the estimate of each standards importance After completing a series of unrelated distractor questionnaires tapping selfesteem and campus attitudes participants then made a set of ratings related to creativity They rated the importance of being creative in their own lives and their past history of being creative using the same 7point scale as in the other questions These two ratings were highly correlated r  57 p  001 and so we collapsed them into a single index1  Results and Discussion The importance of ought and ideal pursuits was modestly correlated r44  24 p  06 suggesting that some individuals were more strongly motivated in general than others They were far from redundant however making it realistic to examine their independent relationship with creativity This was tested by regressing creativity orientation on the importance given to ought and ideal pursuits The main effects were obtained in the first block of the equation This block yielded a significant negative regression weight for ought standards B  075 t45  729 p  01 and a significant positive regression weight for ideal standards B  066 t45  599 p  01 These findings indicate that the importance participants placed on being creative decreased the more they valued ought pursuits but increased the more they valued ideal pursuits2 In the second regression block we entered the interaction term multiplicative crossproduct for ought and ideal pursuits so that we could determine whether there was a statistical interaction between the importance of ought and ideal pursuits in the prediction of creativity importance Blanton and Jaccard 2006 This analysis revealed a significant statistical interaction between the two selfguides B  015 t44  221 p  03 The pattern of this interaction is charted in Figure 1 This shows that individuals who placed the highest value on being creative also showed a combination of high concern for ideals and low concern for oughts These results thus offer preliminary support to our model The obvious shortcomings of this brief pilot are its reliance on selfreport and the correlational nature of the results Two experiments were thus designed to address these limitations by experimentally manipulating the salience of ought or ideal concerns and then measuring their effect on creative responding in an experimental task Graphic Figure 1 Study 1  Overview This study investigated the influence of semantic goal primes on creativity Creativity was assessed using a word association test Eysenck 1995 Although word associations tap only some specific aspects of creative cognition they show significant correlations with various measures of creativity Benedek Knen and Neubauer 2012 Gough 1976 and personality traits such as psychosis proneness Merten 1993 Ward McConaghy and Catts 1991 and were ideal for our purposes because they permit precise quantification of the novelty of a given response By comparing the associations produced with population norms Palermo and Jenkins 1964 we were able to test theories regarding the importance placed on novel creative responding3  Method A sample of 113 students n  88 women participated in a study presented as a project measuring word associations Participants completed a computer task that asked them to type the first word that came to mind after a target word was presented The computer program presented each participant with an empty box followed by a numeric sequence that counted down from 3 to 1 Following this a target word appeared Participants were instructed to enter a word in the box To discourage participants from moving so quickly through the task that dominant word associations might take over the instructions stated that participants need not type the first word that came to mind The task that followed was designed to accomplish two things It primed participants with goal words typically associated with ought evaluative standards or ideal evaluative standards for those in the control condition it presented them with a set of control words These words were chosen based on synonym searches related to ought obligation and moral and were correctly categorized by at least 80 of participants in a sample of 24 college participants see the Appendix Novelty was then assessed by measuring responses to nonprime assessment words The goal words and the assessment words were presented in a nonrandom orderone that was designed to activate and then maintain the salience of relevant constructs while at the same time measuring resulting influences on creativity For those participants who had ought or ideal goal word primes the first three target words were designed to activate concerns related to ethics and duty morality required ought or achievement and accomplishment achieve victory ideal After each of these words participants listed the word association that came to mind This activityof observing a goal word and then generating a relevant associationwas developed as a means of activating mindsets related to the pursuit of ideal or ought goals Immediately after these three primes participants were presented with two trials that presented assessment words eg eagle sell Their task was again to list associations to these words Participants entered the words that came to mind for these words as they did for the goal words For the remaining trials of the task the program alternated between presenting an additional goal word followed by two assessment words It repeated this sequence until the program exhausted a list of 13 goalrelated primes and 22 assessment words The sequence for stimuli presentation in the control condition was identical to the two experimental conditions except that the goalpriming words were chosen to have no relevance to either ought or ideal pursuits eg whistle cabbage The complete list of prime and target words in the task is presented in the Appendix in the order they appeared in the priming task We assessed novelty with a binary rating that coded whether participants listed the most common association for a given prime as determined by word norms documented in studies by Palermo and Jenkins 1964 on word association norms For instance this text identified the most common word association for eagle to be bird and for sell to be buy Participants who chose these words were not given credit for providing a creative answer Those who chose words such as falcon or purchase did receive a score for creativity With 22 target words creativity scores thus ranged from 0 to 22 Because our priming procedure might influence mood which can exert general influences selfregulation independent of regulatory focus Higgins 2000 as well as creative cognition Baas et al 2008 participants finished the study by completing the 20item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule PANAS Watson Clark and Tellegen 1988 so that any potential confounding influences of primes on mood could be measured and controlled  Results The influence of priming on creative responding was determined by conducting threecell oneway analysis of variance ANOVA on novelty of associations to test for differences among participants in ought n  39 ideal n  37 or control n  37 conditions This revealed a significant effect of condition on novel responding F2 110  807 p  01 The nature of this effect was that participants exposed to ideal primes related to achievement and accomplishment produced more creative word associations M  1141 SD  249 than did those in the control condition M  1005 SD  267 t110  411 p  01 whereas those in the ought condition exposed to primes related to duty and obligation produced fewer creative words M  902 SD  259 t110  245 p  05 than those in the control condition To gain some insight into the underlying processes leading to these shifts we examined response latencies recording the time between target onset and completion of the word association entry and found no significant differences between conditions Fs  1 This suggests that participants in the experimental conditions were not speeding up or slowing down to choose more creative words However this finding should be viewed with caution as individual differences in typing speed and chosen word length were quite large and so the response latency data in this study were too noisy for drawing strong inference Finally we observed no effects of primes on positive or negative affect Fs  1 and controlling for momentary affect did not influence statistical significance of analyses examining the influence of regulatory priming on creativity  Study 2  Method The purpose of Study 2 was to gain some insight into the mechanisms underlying these shifts The first study was structured to minimize competition with dominant word associations Participants were given explicit instructions not to focus only on the first word that came to mind It is possible that the first word that came to mind was similar across conditions but participants in ideal condition resisted the pull of the obvious to make more novel associations In contrast those in the ought condition might have held back on responding until they thought of a word that seemed common enough to feel appropriate If such an account is true then one might predict that there would be observable differences in the time of responding between the two experimental conditions and the control No such difference was observed but the noisiness of reaction time data for this type of task prevents strong interpretation of this null finding To critically examine the stage at which the primes influenced novelty and whether the responses in Study 1 suggest a relatively controlled influence of evaluative standards we designed Experiment 2 to introduce a new condition speeded responding This study employed the same procedure as Study 1 only this time incorporating a 2 instruction set high or low time pressure  2 prime ought vs ideal evaluative standards factorial design with 25 participants per experimental condition Those in the lowtimepressure condition were given the same instructions as in Study 1 In contrast those in the hightimepressure condition were instructed to type the first word that comes to mind in the box provided From comparisons between the high and lowtimepressure conditions in Study 2 analyses could investigate whether the changes observed in Study 2 likely occurred spontaneously or whether they instead required a degree of cognitive control As in Study 1 the PANAS was administered after the priming procedure to test for mood influences  Results A 2 instruction set  2 prime factorial ANOVA revealed a significant interaction only between priming condition and speed F1 96  443 p  04 The nature of this effect was that in the lowtimepressure condition participants in the ought condition produced significantly fewer creative word associations M  960 SD  191 than those in the creative prime condition M  1128 SD  228 t96  255 p  01 This pattern replicated the results of Study 1 In contrast participants in the speeded condition showed no difference between those in the ought condition M  1028 SD  151 and those in the ideal condition M  1000 SD  255 t  1 Examination of the response latencies associated with responding indicated that individuals in the lowtimepressure condition took an additional 23 s to respond p  001 but there were no differences or interactions due to the nature of the prime These results suggest that the differences in novelty observed in Study 1 reflected some degree of cognitive control over responding with participants moving either in a more conventional less creative direction when ought concerns were activated or in a less conventional more creative direction when ideal concerns were activated Under speeded conditions the dominant word associations drove responding and there was no influence of primes Finally no effects of priming or instruction set on positive or negative mood were observed ps  20 and entering these scores as a covariate did not influence the statistical significance of analyses investigating the influence of regulatory primes on creativity  General Discussion It is generally accepted that creativity flows best from an intrinsic motivation to be creative The current study introduced a potential caveat to that by studying indirect links between trait interest pilot study and state activation Studies 1 and 2 of selfguides as predictors of creative output The pilot study established that the desire to be creative was lowest among people who place a high value on living up to duty and obligation in the form of ought selfguides and little value on personal achievement in the form of ideal selfguides Two experimental studies then manipulated the salience of these two goal orientations and showed that activation of ought selfguides inhibited creative output whereas activation of ideal selfguides facilitated it The experimental studies offered additional evidence into the manner by which these two internalized goal sets influence creative output Study 1 demonstrated that relative to controls priming of motivational states related to achievement and accomplishment led to more novel word associations and priming of motivational states related to duty and obligation led to less novel word associations These findings complement the considerable research linking regulatory focus to creative cognition Baas et al 2008 Frster and Dannenberg 2010 Friedman and Frster 2001 2002 by tying creativity to the goal standards that are an important determinant of regulatory focus Moretti and Higgins 1999 Study 2 replicated these effects but showed that the original result was eliminated on speeded trials This pattern suggests that goal activation influenced creative expression not creative cognition Put another way we do not assume or believe that priming influenced accessibility of different words Rather we believe that ideal priming motivated participants to take the time they needed to think of more novel word choices perhaps skipping the more accessible less creative choices that came to mind first In contrast ought priming did not motivate participants to take the time for creative pursuits perhaps leading them to choose the first word that was sufficient to the instructions to produce a word This interpretation is compatible with research on the serial order effect Christensen Guilford and Wilson 1957 argued that mundane ideas come to mind before novel ones and that individual differences in creativity are marked by the tendency to suppress mundane responses until creative ideas manifest  Creative Conformity Our analysis might offer a deceptively straightforward approach to promoting creativity It suggests that educators should encourage students to view creativity as an ideal they should strive to achieve rather than as a duty they are obliged to perform This is a reasonable interpretation but there is a complication Blanton and Christie 2003 reviewed evidence suggesting that it is difficult to use ideals to promote actions of a group because ideals motivate individuals to distinguish themselves from the group Whereas all individuals who adhere to the same ought moral and social codes are obligated to follow certain prescribed courses of action eg to be truthful to avoid harming others not to yell fire in a movie theater the same cannot be said of their ideals One individual might aspire to be a musician another an actor and another a social psychologist Each of these individuals is free to pursue his or her distinct ideals even if each is also bound to a shared sense of obligation This analysis points to a challenge of motivating creative output as an ideal Ideals promote unique choices and so efforts to promote creativity as an ideal to pursue work against that very function If an educator promotes creativity as an ideal in a large group no single member can express his or her uniqueness by internalizing a shared goal And there is another problem If an educator were successful in getting a group of students to pursue less mundane solutions the teacher would effectively alter the definition of mundane Consider that the novelty of any given individuals expression is intimately tied to most definitions of the creativity of that act Sternberg and Lubart 1999 Torrance 1974 In our laboratory task for instance participants were designated as creative to the extent that they broke from the population norm for word associations Imagine however if the ideal condition were run hundreds more times Over time if this intervention continued to exert influence on groups of students a new norm would be established for this population of individuals in the ideal condition and so by definition the majority would no longer be designated as creative Our creativity manipulation might thus have the ironic effect of creating a new norm and thus a new way for the majority to be mundane We think the lesson here is not to abandon the emphasis on treating creativity as an ideal Educators have a role to play and we think it is better served by promoting creativity as an ideal rather than an obligation However the lesson from this analysis is that ideals are probably less useful when used to promote specific ways of acting creatively This point is obscured by our choice of methods In our study participants had no choice but to make word associations and when ideals were triggered they responded by thinking outside a particular normative box In real life however individuals who are taught to value creativity as an ideal have the freedom to define the tasks that interest them and to define their own metrics of success Perhaps one idealistic student will become an actor and another a musician If a third student decides she also wants to act or create music she can do so in ways that let her maintain a distinct identity In contrast if she felt that she had to perform such actions out of a sense of duty she might treat the first two individuals as specific models for how she could satisfy her obligation We thus view the promotion of creative ideals in education as a general means of releasing interest in being creativein some form or anothernot as a strategy for promoting any specific creative pursuit or any specific creative expression of that pursuit  Limitations and Future Directions These studies were designed to build on prior work demonstrating regulatory links to creative cognition by providing a direct test of an association between self standards and creative cognition We established that such links are viable but our findings are limited by the narrow range of phenomena studied First we only examined selfreported interest in creativity and novelty of word associations in our pilot study This work would benefit from consideration of other markers of creativity and other forms of creative insight and expression see Cropley 2000 Of more critical concern is the need to examine more fully the complex interplay between goal pursuit and goal attainment Evaluative standards can have different influences on individuals depending on whether individuals feel that they have lived up to those goals or not Higgins 1987 We did not examine whether selfdiscrepancy influences creative production but such an effect might have been observed if we had compared individuals who felt they were making progress on their goals with those who did not feel that way Recent research suggests that selfdiscrepancy may be important at least for understanding the influence of ought standards on creative expression Baas De Dreu and Nijstad 2011 found that although promotionfocused states generally increase creativity prevention states could increase or diminish creativity depending on progress made Specifically it was only when participants felt that their prevention goals were mostly achieved that a prevention focus resulted in reduced creative expression In contrast when participants felt their prevention goals were not yet achieved those states were linked to more creative cognition Internal analysis suggested that this occurred because when prevention goals are frustrated individuals become more engaged and thus more creative These findings suggest that had we prescreened for individuals with large discrepancies between their current states and ought selfguides see Higgins 1987 ought activation might have promoted more creative cognition Future research will benefit from greater attention to these and other differences in how people construe evaluative standards as they relate to creative cognition  Conclusion With these caveats in mind our findings suggest that the way people approach their goals can influence creative output Creativity seems most likely when the individual is striving to express an ideal not when the individual is responding

research so far is rather inconclusive with some studies reporting substantial declines in selfesteem late in life whereas others report relative stability into old age In this article we examine longterm change trajectories in selfesteem in old age and very old age and link them to key correlates in the health cognitive selfregulatory and social domains To do so we estimated growth curve models over chronological age and timetodeath using 18year longitudinal data from the Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing N  1215 age 65103 years at first occasion M  788 years SD  59 women 45 of sample Results revealed that selfesteem was on average fairly stable with minor declines only emerging in advanced ages and at the very end of life Examination of the vast betweenperson differences revealed that lower cognitive abilities and lower perceived control independently related to lower selfesteem Also lower cognitive abilities were associated with steeper agerelated and mortalityrelated selfesteem decrements In our discussion we consider a variety of challenges that potentially shape selfesteem late in life and highlight the need for more mechanismoriented research to better understand the pathways underlying stability and change in selfesteem  One major theme of personality and life span research has long been whether and how key aspects of the self are preserved when people are faced with major challenges of late life M M Baltes and Carstensen 1996 Brandtstdter and Greve 1994 Cross and Markus 1991 Freund and Smith 1999 Orth Trzesniewski and Robins 2010 Robins Trzesniewski Tracy Gosling and Potter 2002 Troll and Skaff 1997 One important indicator of the self is selfesteem which revolves around a general evaluation and appraisal of ones worth Leary and Baumeister 2000 Orth Robins and Widaman 2011 Selfregulation theories emphasize the adaptive capacities of the selfsystem Brandtstdter and Renner 1990 Brickman and Campbell 1971 Charles and Carstensen 2010 However empirical findings on selfesteem in old age are rather inconclusive with some studies reporting sizeable declines Orth et al 2010 Shaw Liang and Krause 2010 whereas others report relative stability into old age Huang 2010 Marsh Martin and Jackson 2010 In our study we moved several steps beyond extant research by focusing on a phase of life namely very old age during which selfregulatory mechanisms that usually keep the self stable may reach their limits P B Baltes and Smith 2003 Specifically we examined selfesteem trajectories over a broad age range of 35 years across old and very old ages 65103 years and investigated whether and how selfesteem changes in the last years of life We also explored some of the factors that may contribute to the betweenperson heterogeneity that is often observed in selfesteem trajectories Erol and Orth 2011 Going this route allowed us to better understand how variables in the health cognitive selfregulatory and social domains shape selfesteem late in life To do so we applied latent growth curve models to 18year longitudinal data obtained from 1215 by now deceased participants from the Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing ALSA  Stability or Change in SelfEsteem in Old Age It has long been proposed that people have an inherent need to feel good about themselves James 18901950 Accordingly selfesteem is considered a fundamental human concern Bushman Moeller and Crocker 2011 Sheldon Elliot Kim and Kasser 2001 and has become one of the most investigated constructs in psychological research Leary 1999 Despite this long and rich history of research there is little established knowledge about the normative trajectories of change that selfesteem exhibits in old age In particular studies converge in reporting that average levels of selfesteem are relatively stable or even increase until people reach retirement age whereas highly divergent results are often reported for postretirement ages For example Orth et al 2010 reported in one of the few longitudinal studies that populationlevel differences in selfesteem between ages of 60 and 97 amounted to d  068 see also Shaw et al 2010 In a crosssectional study Robins et al 2002 also found average levels of selfesteem to decline in late adulthood but the amount of declines was shallower d  008 in the 60s through the 70s and d  029 in the 70s through the 80s In contrast other studies have reported that selfesteem remains fairly robust even in old age Huang 2010 Marsh et al 2010 Pullmann Allik and Realo 2009 Wagner Lang Neyer and Wagner 2012 For example Huang in his 2010 metaanalysis reported that average differences between ages 50 and 60 years were d  07 and average differences for ages 60 and older were minimal as well d  007 We note that the relative scarcity of longitudinal data and of observations obtained from people in their 80s and 90s precludes drawing more conclusive inferences about how selfesteem develops in old and especially very old age see also Huang 2010 Trzesniewski Donnellan and Robins 2003 Why would selfesteem be stable across old age or why would it change To begin with theories of selfregulation have long highlighted that adaptive capacities are robust well into late life Brandtstdter and Renner 1990 Brickman and Campbell 1971 Charles and Carstensen 2010 For example people may come to terms with losses and unattainable goals by adjusting their aspiration levels or by disengaging from initially important goals and thereby maintain a coherent sense of themselves see Heckhausen and Schulz 1995 Indeed several lines of empirical work have provided convincing support of adaptive aging eg possible selves Smith and Freund 2002 emotion regulation Carstensen Fung and Charles 2003 social integration Wrzus Kckeritz Wagner and Neyer 2012 It thus appears reasonable to assume that people adjust on average reasonably well to the changes imposed by transitions into retirement eg fewer financial possibilities loss of social roles obsolete occupational expertise and skills see Orth et al 2010 Although these processes appear to be highly efficient throughout adulthood and old age it is possible that the nature of change often imposed by advanced old age challenges selfregulatory capacity to the point where it reaches its limits P B Baltes and Smith 2003 Gerstorf and Ram 2009 Gerstorf Ram Lindenberger and Smith in press First of all people are increasingly at risk of being confronted with transitions or critical life events that are outside their control particularly those that are almost normative for very old people such as declining health eg disability or social losses eg bereavement These challenges may simply become too frequent or too severe in advanced old age thereby making adjustment more and more difficult Second the selfregulation system itself may become increasingly compromised and capabilities that have worked highly efficiently across adulthood to recover from perturbations become more and more fragile for example due to cognitive limitations  SelfEsteem Trajectories at the End of Life Reaching back to seminal work in the 1960s and 1970s Kleemeier 1962 Palmore and Cleveland 1976 Riegel and Riegel 1972 Siegler 1975 it has long been established that latelife changes are often not only influenced by agerelated factors but also by factors related to approaching death In particular the terminal decline concept suggests that progressive mechanisms leading toward death fundamentally shape the course and nature of changes that often accompany the last years and months of life Empirical studies examining how mortalityrelated processes unfold have described and extracted systematic withinperson changes in individuals behavior and experience along a timetodeath time axis for an alternative approach see Ghisletta McArdle and Lindenberger 2006 Evidence for precipitous proximatetodeath declines that are often considerably steeper than the typical agerelated effects has primarily accumulated in cognitive ability domains for overviews see Bckman and MacDonald 2006 S Berg 1996 Small and Bckman 1999 However there is an increasing body of research showing that many aspects of wellbeing also show steep endoflife declines A I Berg Hassing Thorvaldsson and Johansson 2011 Diehr Williamson Burke and Psaty 2002 Gerstorf et al 2008 2010 Mroczek and Spiro 2005 Palgi et al 2010 There is even initial evidence to suggest that terminal decline is a highly pervasive phenomenon that affects many different domains including those often considered relatively stable across old and very old age Gerstorf et al in press It is an open question whether people manage to maintain a reasonably positive view of the self until the very last phase of life Based on the previously described considerations one may expect selfesteem to exhibit latelife deterioration as well The overarching question is whether selfprotective processes are still resilient enough to help people adjust to the likely losses they are faced with or whether the pervasive nature of endoflife decrements pushes individuals adaptive capacities to their limits The initial evidence suggests that some domains particularly in the sensory cognitive and health areas are more prone to mortalityrelated change than other domains particularly in the selfregulation and social areas Gerstorf et al in press For example linear mortalityrelated declines amounted to an average of 16 SD units in the last 10 years for the cognitive marker the Digit Letter Test for details see Lindenberger and Baltes 1997 and 09 SD units for the selfregulatory marker perceived control These preliminary reports from other partly related domains eg perceived control Erol and Orth 2011 suggest that the last years of life may be accompanied by accelerated deteriorations in selfesteem but that the overall effect size of those changes is probably smaller relative to the effects observed in other domains  Correlates of LateLife SelfEsteem Trajectories Extant research on factors contributing to betweenperson differences in selfesteem has revealed that feedback from peers Leary and Baumeister 2000 Leary Tambor Terdal and Downs 1995 and relationship with parents Harter 2006 Ojanen and Perry 2007 as well as achievements Marsh and Craven 2006 Trautwein Ldtke Kller and Baumert 2006 along with athletic competences and physical appearance Harter 1993 2006 are all crucial correlates of selfesteem in the first half of life For example Harter 2006 illustrated that adolescents transition from elementary school to junior high school is often accompanied by considerable changes in selfesteem and that such shifts are mostly due to a change in how successful adolescents are in important domains of life However less is known about the sources and correlates of selfesteem in old age Some of these sources such as the ones in the work domain are no longer available after people have reached retirement ages As a consequence other factors may become increasingly important These factors can be important sources of selfesteem but they can also represent risk factors as we will later detail In the current study we assumed that sociodemographic variables as well as variables in the health cognitive selfregulatory and social domains are of key importance in determining selfesteem late in life To begin with gender differences in selfesteem have long been reported from samples of young and middleaged adults typically with higher selfesteem among men relative to women Kling Hyde Showers and Buswell 1999 However there is evidence to suggest that these differences are considerably smaller in old age Orth et al 2010 Robins et al 2002 or even nonexistent Huang 2010 probably because late life is related to less strict social and role expectations Freund 2000 Education can be regarded as a generalpurpose resource that links to a variety of factors ranging from finances to coping strategies that often help individuals achieve their goals and deal efficiently with changing living conditions Consistent with this idea people with higher educational achievements were repeatedly found to report higher selfesteem Orth et al 2010 Shaw et al 2010 Finally studies of young adults have revealed that being single is related to lower selfesteem particularly among men Lehnart Neyer and Eccles 2010 Neyer and Lehnart 2007 Wagner Ldtke Jonkmann and Trautwein in press This is argued to be due to the normativity of establishing a first partnership in young adulthood However given that living without a partner is much more common when people are in their 80s and 90s we would not expect considerable differences related to marital status anymore As a second set of crucial selfesteem correlates in late life we examined variables in the health domain Previous studies have indicated that people who reported being in good health also reported higher selfesteem Orth et al 2010 Reitzes and Mutran 2006 Shaw et al 2010 To move toward a more comprehensive health assessment we made use of three indicators a medical checklist reporting the current chronic medical conditions functional limitations and disabilities and selfrated health As a marker of cognitive abilities we chose perceptual speed which is highly reliable and sensitive to change throughout adulthood Anstey Hofer and Luszcz 2003 Gerstorf Hoppmann Anstey and Luszcz 2009 and as a cognitive primitive is conceptually closer to a resource than other cognitive abilities Luszcz and Bryan 1999 As a fourth set of correlates we drew from conceptual and empirical work highlighting the role of perceived control for successful aging Heckhausen Wrosch and Schulz 2010 Infurna Gerstorf Robertson Berg and Zarit 2010 Specifically perceptions of and strivings for control appear to play a pivotal role in the context of active selfesteem recovery after loss or failure for example through the use of selfprotective strategies such as goal disengagement or downward comparison Such control strategies are important throughout the life span but may become particularly important with the increased risks of loss experiences in old age see also Brandtstdter 1999 Aspects of perceived control have indeed been linked with shaping selfesteem in early adulthood Erol and Orth 2011 and we examined such associations in a later phase of life A final correlate revolves around the social domain For example consistent with sociometer theory selfesteem often shows strong associations with social inclusion and positive social interactions Denissen Penke Schmitt and van Aken 2008 Leary and Baumeister 2000 Leary et al 1995 Because close social relationships constitute a relatively stable and important aspect of latelife functioning Lang and Carstensen 2002 Wrzus et al 2012 we expected to find that the social domain continues to play a key role in shaping peoples selfesteem Taken together a thorough investigation of the role of these factors promised to help identify some of the risk factors for and protective living conditions against selfesteem decline late in life  The Present Study In the current study we examined whether and how selfesteem changes at the end of life and explored factors that contribute to betweenperson differences in such change To do so we applied growth models to longterm longitudinal data over chronological age and timetodeath metrics from 1215 deceased participants in the ALSA As an extension of studies examining how selfesteem changes when people are in their 60s and 70s we expected selfesteem to show considerable decline in people in their 80s and 90s and in those approaching death We also expected that variables in the health cognitive selfregulatory and social domains would shape the course of selfesteem change late in life  Method  Procedure This report was based on the Australian Longitudinal Study of Aging ALSA Luszcz 1998 The ALSA is a populationbased psychobiosocial and behavioral study with participants from Adelaide Australia The first wave of data collection started in 1992 and since then 10 followup waves with varying study intervals have been conducted The study consists of an extensive personal interview including among other things psychosocial behavioral social and contextual variables Detailed information on study procedures and constructs can be found in Andrews Clark and Luszcz 2002 Anstey et al 2003 and Luszcz Bryan and Kent 1997  Participants At baseline in 1992 the ALSA sample comprised 2087 participants stratified by age and gender into four cohorts 7074 years 7579 years 8084 years and 85  years age M  7816 SD  669 range  65103 years with those 85 years and older as well as men being oversampled Information about mortality status of participants was updated in July 2011 from city registries when 825 or 1722 of the original participants were known to have died With an interest in latelife changes we included in our report all ALSA participants who a were deceased by July 2011 and b had contributed one or more waves of selfesteem data in the last 10 years of life resulting in a sample of 1215 old and very old adults who were 65 through 103 years old at baseline M  788 SD  59 men were 55 of the sample About 54 had left school by age 14 or younger The majority of participants were married 66 Included in our study were all participants who provided valid data on key measures of our study selfesteem social participation As a consequence it was not possible to compare participants included in our report with those not included on these key measures However information for those not included was available on most other variables Thus selectivity analyses with all participants at Time 1 T1 and those included in the current sample showed that those included participants were more likely to be male d  020 have had a higher education d  014 have reported more medical conditions d  019 and have indicated lower internal control d  027 At the same time the two groups did not differ from each other with respect to marital status functional limitations and selfreported health nor with respect to cognitive abilities and perceived loneliness These analyses suggest that existing differences are small to marginal in effect size and thus may be indicative of only small selectivity effects For our analyses we used six waves of longitudinal data spanning 18 years As is common in research of old and very old individuals sample attrition primarily due to mortality was considerable Specifically the following numbers of individuals were selected at each measurement occasion at baseline T1 in 1992 n  1215 at T3 in 1994 n  1069 at T6 in 2000 n  505 at T7 in 2003 n  257 at T9 in 2008 n  52 and at T11 in 2011 n  18 Selfesteem was not assessed at T2 T4 T5 T8 or T10 On average T3 took place 203 years SD  052 after T1 T6 799 years SD  041 T7 1107 years SD  045 T9 1538 years SD  082 and T11 1778 years SD  043 respectively Across the six waves the 1215 participants provided 2435 observations M  200 SD  107 More specifically one data point on selfesteem was available for 472 two waves for 435 three waves for 173 four for 108 five for 20 and six for seven participants To quantify longitudinal selectivity we used an effectsize metric that indicates the degree to which individuals of our selected sample who participated in three or more waves n  525 differed from those with fewer data points for details see Lindenberger Singer and Baltes 2002 Total selectivity amounted to 017 SD units where SD refers to that of the 2087 participants from the ALSA sample for selfesteem 018 SD for chronological age 090 SD for time to death 013 SD for gender 003 SD for education 009 SD for marital status 004 SD for comorbidities 012 SD for functional limitations 022 SD for selfrated health 026 SD for perceptual speed 026 SD for perceived control 017 SD for social participation and 007 SD for loneliness This suggests that higher levels of selfesteem at T1 younger age longer time to death better health preserved cognitive functioning higher perceived control more social participation and less loneliness were associated with subsequently lower mortality and higher participation rates among survivors Effects of sample selectivity were primarily due to mortality eg selfesteem 71 of the total effect of 017 SD units rather than to dropout for other reasons The statistical procedures used in our analyses handled this type of nonrandom attrition however we acknowledge that participants with the most longitudinal information represent a positively selected subset of the initial ALSA sample  Measures  Selfesteem The Bachman revision 1970 of Rosenbergs SelfEsteem Scale was used in the ALSA study It comprised 10 items I feel that I have a number of good qualities with four items being reversecoded I think I am no good at all Participants were asked to indicate how often each statement was true on a 5point Likert scale ranging from 1 almost always true to 5 never true Prior to computing individual mean scores we reversecoded the positive items such that higher numbers indicate higher selfesteem Reliability analyses showed satisfactory internal consistency across the entire study Cronbachs alpha  78  Correlates Included in our models was information about participants age date of death gender marital status married vs not married and education indicated by the age people left school from 1 never went to school 2 less than 14 years to 7 18 or more years We also examined resources in the health cognitive selfregulative and social domain as correlates of late life changes in selfesteem see Table 1 for descriptive statistics Graphic Table 1 Health Health was based on three measures Medical conditions were selfreports of the number of current chronic medical conditions from a comprehensive list of 61 eg stroke diabetes arthritis Functional limitations were measured by responses to two mobility items Rosow and Breslau 1966 and to five disability items Nagi 1976 If participants had any degree of difficulty with any of these seven items they received a score of 1 these were summed so that higher scores indicate more functional limitations Selfrated health was based on a oneitem measure on which participants rated their current overall health on a 5point Likertscale  Cognitive We assessed cognitive correlates with the Digit Symbol Substitution subscale of the revised Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Wechsler 1981 for details see Luszcz et al 1997 As a parsimonious measure of psychomotor speed participants were asked to substitute symbols corresponding to numbers from 1 to 9 as rapidly as possible into a randomly ordered array of 93 digits Symbols with corresponding numbers were present throughout the task We included the number of correct substitutions in 90 s  Selfregulative The selfregulative correlates were based on a 12item scale of perceived control from the Expectancy of Control subscale of the Desired Control Measure Luszcz 1998 adapted from Reid and Zeigler 1981 On this measure respondents indicated the extent of their perceived control on a 5point Likert scale ranging from 1 strongly agree to 5 strongly disagree Estimates were based on a sum score of reversedcoded items such that higher scores on the scale illustrate more internal control whereas lower scores illustrate more external control  Social The social resources included two indicators Social participation was based on four items of the Adelaide Activity Profile Clark and Bond 2000 The items assessed the frequency of four sociallife aspects including active social participation eg Having invited other people to ones home Items were rated on a 4point Likertscale with higher scores related to more activity To index lonelinesss we selected one item from the Center of Epidemiological StudiesDepression Scale Radloff 1977 Participants were asked to indicate how often over the past week they had felt lonely Again higher scores on a 4point Likertscale index greater loneliness</content></resource><resource><rank>0.143192</rank><id>4</id><content>				Although one may not always see it social life often involves choices that make people act in ways that are mindful of others or not We adopt an interdependence theoretical approach to the novel concept of social mindfulness which we conceptualize in terms of otherregarding choices involving both skill to see it eg theory of mind perspective taking and will to do it eg empathic concern prosocial orientation to act mindfully toward another persons control over outcomes We operationalized social mindfulness in a new social decisionmaking paradigm that focuses on leaving or limiting choice options for others that we tested across 7 studies Studies 1a through 1c showed that people with otheroriented mindsets left interdependent others more choice than people with selforiented andor unspecified mindsets Studies 2a and 2b revealed that people developed more favorable judgments of a socially mindful than of a socially unmindful person Study 3 revealed that unknown others with trustworthy vs untrustworthy faces were met with more social mindfulness Study 4 revealed that social mindfulness could be traced in personality by being positively related to HonestyHumility and Agreeableness HEXACO Personality InventoryRevised as well as to Empathy Interpersonal Reactivity Index and a prosocial value orientation SVO Together these studies contribute to explaining how social mindfulness can help people to navigate the social world by aiming to maximize other peoples control over their situational outcomes  Prosocial behavior comes in many flavors and social mindfulness might well be one of them Being socially mindful means to safeguard other peoples control over their own behavioral options in situations of interdependence Recently the concept of mindfulness has become a household term in both clinical and social psychology Mindfulnessbased psychotherapy for instance has shown to be an effective therapy for depression and anxiety disorders eg Chiesa and Serretti 2011 Greeson 2009 Hofmann Sawyer Witt and Oh 2010 and everyday mindfulness as described by Langer 1989 1992 allows for more openness to all the options and alternatives that life has to offereven providing a feeling of empowerment Langer Blank and Chanowitz 1978 However contemporary discussions of mindfulness often overlook the original otherorientedness that is embedded in its Buddhist heritage Black 2011 cf Gergen 2009 Other than the prevalent inward awareness and inner dialogue of modern mindfulness social mindfulness doubles back to its roots by incorporating a benevolent focus on the needs and interests of others General mindfulness starts with paying attention to the little things available to individual awareness social mindfulness starts at a similar basic level In daily life it may sometimes be understood as simply being considerate or being polite An example would be to deliberately not take the last peanut butter cookie from a plate that also holds a couple of chocolate chip cookies Undoubtedly various personal motivations andor preferences may play a role in these kinds of decisions but a readily available reason for refraining from taking the last single cookie is to leave a next person something to choose fromeven if that is only the polite thing to do Key factors in this decision process are to acknowledge the immediate or expected inclusion of someone else in a given situation assess the effect of ones actions on the remaining behavioral options for the other ie interdependence is seen and established and the level of positive regard given to this other Do I really care if uncle John cant choose which cookie he wants as long as he can still have one Subtle but as we argue socially effective actions like leaving or limiting choice options for others requires a process of both perspective taking and empathic concernuncle John might indeed get really upset and not want to play soccer anymore Perspective Taking and Empathic Concern are two of the four domains that Davis 1980 1983 distinguished in the multidimensional concept of empathythe other domains are Fantasy Scale and Personal Distress Separately or in combination these can be used to explain many otheroriented capacities andor tendencies Investigating social mindfulness as a human capacity in which the cognitive component of perspective taking and the affective component of empathic concern work together to signal prosocial intentions offers a practical and concise method to look at an underinvestigated way of how people may balance a need for social inclusion with a need for individual differentiation Brewer 1991 2012 The mindful sequence of to see it ie the perspective of the other person and to do it ie to make choices that leave room for that other requires both skill and will  Socially Mindful Social mindfulness is minding the needs and interests of others in a way that honors the idea that most people like to choose for themselves ie have a certain need for autonomy Deci and Ryan 2012 In terms of interdependence theory eg Kelley and Thibaut 1978 Van Lange and Rusbult 2012 social mindfulness seeks to maximize other peoples control over their own outcomes The socially mindful person makes sure that he or she does not determine or close up situations for others as far as outcomes are concerned In interdependence theory situations that require suspension of immediate personal preferences for the sake of others have been relatively underexposed and in our eyes deserve some attention As mentioned being socially mindful can be as simple as not taking the last peanut butter cookie when there are still other alternatives left Situations like these make a good anchor point for any new measure of social mindfulness Leaving or limiting outcome options for others will therefore constitute the core of the current investigation  Skill and Will Perspective taking is a wellresearched phenomenon eg Batson Early and Salvarani 1997 Ruby and Decety 2004 Neural correlates of this human capacity for instance can be traced back to regions in the medial prefrontal cortex see Amodio and Frith 2006 Related to perspective taking is the concept of theory of mind ToM which enables people to attribute mental statesfor example beliefs intentions desires knowledgeto oneself and to others and to understand that those others have beliefs desires and intentions that are different from ones own eg BaronCohen TagerFlusberg and Cohen 1993 Wimmer and Perner 1983 A basic ToM allows people to know that others have thoughts and feelings in the same way that they have and thus recognizes the others as cognizant and sentient Decety and Batson 2007 An advanced ToM extends this ability to more complex situations in which other peoples perspectives may require some effort to assess Yet another approach to acknowledge the views and feelings of others for example used in personcentered and experiential approaches to psychotherapy is called mentalizing or to become aware of the presence and quality of mental states in self and others eg Allen 2006 Allen Fonagy and Bateman 2008 Building on this extensive body of research we reason that the skill to process other peoples perspective will vary between people and between situations thus laying down the affordance for social mindfulness Skill will set the perimeters but the will to follow up is another issue Early research has shown that especially affective perspective taking connects to a cooperative predisposition and altruistic behavior rather than the ability to take the physical perspective of others eg D W Johnson 1975a 1975b Oswald 1996 Vaish Carpenter and Tomasello 2009 Affective perspective taking is part of the human faculty of empathy mostly related to empathic concern As the capacity to feel for and with others one could expect empathic concern to play an important part in a benevolent approach to the needs and wishes of others and therefore in social mindfulness Motivating factors like these will bring the ability for perspective taking or mentalizing online In other words One needs the skill to assess for the will to address  Interdependence Our conceptualization of social mindfulness is deeply rooted in interdependence theory which emphasizes the role of social orientations such as cooperation and fairness in settings of outcome interdependence Kelley and Thibaut 1978 Social mindfulness as we define and operationalize it extends the focus on outcome interdependence by including the notion that peoples behavioral choices and actions may codetermine the range of possible outcomes for others rather than just the outcome itself cf Kelley et al 2003 Van Lange and Rusbult 2012 In order to investigate these specific instances of interdependence we asked participants in our experiments to imagine being in a dyadic situation in which choices by the one would leave or limit outcome options for the other The operationalization of social mindfulness we discuss in this article was inspired by the penchoice paradigm initially used by Kim and Markus 1999 and further developed by Yamagishi Hashimoto and Schug 2008 see also Hashimoto Li and Yamagishi 2011 In this paradigm people were asked to pick one among five pens that came in two colors The ratio was always two to three pens of the same color or one to four This obviously made one color the majority and the other the minority Both research groups framed their findings in terms of cultural differences but Yamagishi et al 2008 see also Hashimoto et al 2011 argued that instead of being internalized cultural norms which is the point of the Kim and Markus 1999 study preferences for minority versus majority objects were driven by strategies that people follow as what may be called cultural game players Hashimoto et al 2011 p 140 cf Yamagishi et al 2012 They reached this conclusion by noticing that when by themselves or the last to choose and thus without any social pressure most people seemed to prefer the unique option regardless of cultural background Picking the unique object therefore can be seen as the default choice in absence of other extrinsically motivating factors Clearly choosing one object rather than the other can be the result of a strategic choice In order to transpose the penchoice paradigm from unique versus majority choices to a measure of social mindfulness we limited the total number of choice options to three with a standard ratio of one to two eg one blue pen and two green pens Also we repeated similar choices by adding more objects than pens alone Furthermore the setting was always dyadic and the choices socially consequential Choosing one object would remove it for the other person In this set up choosing the object of which there were two would leave the second person something to choose between a blue or a green pen whereas a first choice for the unique object would limit the options because there would only be two identical objects left to choose from In interdependence terms we reasoned that the first persons choice for the doubled object would count as cooperativemindful because it grants the second person control over the same amount and quality of options that were available to the first person A first move for the unique object however removes this control Granting this kind of control may have prosocial motives cf Magee and Langner 2008 because it allows the other to have as much autonomous control over the outcome as the situation will allow This reasoning also taps into selfdetermination theory eg Deci and Ryan 2000 2012 in which autonomy is regarded as a basic need Providing someone with a certain degree of autonomy or at least not taking it away may be perceived as an action that honors the needs and the perspective of the other in other words as an act of social mindfulness In the same realm social value orientations SVOs are conceptually related to social mindfulness In past research three major types of SVO have received most attention including a a prosocial orientation that seeks to enhance own and others outcomes as well as equality in outcomes b an individualistic orientation that seeks to enhance outcomes for self and is largely indifferent to outcomes for another person and c a competitive orientation that seeks to enhance the difference between outcomes for self and other in favor of the self Messick and McClintock 1968 Van Lange Otten De Bruin and Joireman 1997 Thus relative to individualists and competitors prosocials tend to be more otherregarding in that they are more strongly oriented toward helping others and pursuing equality in outcomes Van Lange 1999 expect others to be otherregarding as well Kuhlman Camac and Cunha 1986 and tend to view various interdependence situations in terms of fairness and morality for a review see Balliet Parks and Joireman 2009 Van Lange Schippers and Balliet 2011 Prosocial more than individualistic or competitive orientations therefore can be expected to favor mindful behaviors that safeguard variation in optionsor choicefor others  Research Overview and Hypotheses Social mindfulness seeks to maximize other peoples control over their own outcomes in situations of interdependence this makes it an effective tool for signaling and estimating prosocial intentions To introduce and investigate this novel construct we conducted seven studies with the concomitant goal of testing our new paradigm the Social Mindfulness SoMi paradigm see the General Method section below Social mindfulness makes people leave choice for others out of otherregard Being specifically otheroriented therefore should lead to higher levels of social mindfulness than being selforiented orientation hypothesis For a clear test of concurrent validity we designed an experiment in which we explicitly told our participants to mind either their own or another persons best interest Study 1a Because the wish to gain more information about others might also influence whether to leave someone else a choice or not we planned a replication with the additional instruction that participants would not be informed about the other persons choices Study 1b Next to gaining information choosing behavior may also arise from a selfserving wish to make a favorable impression on others This possible alternative explanation we addressed in a second replication Study 1c Our general argument holds that social mindfulness signals prosocial intentions But for this signal to be functional it must of course also be understood as such We tested this in two studies In a laboratory setting Study 2a looked at how participants would react after witnessing various levels of social mindfulness We expected to find that a socially mindful person would be liked better and trusted more than a socially unmindful person ie someone who leaves the other with little or no choice perceived mindfulness hypothesis In Study 2b we sought to replicate this in an online study using a different and USbased population Because trust and trustworthiness make investing in social relationships a safer bet one of our general expectations was that trust would play a role in social mindfulness not only in the sense that socially mindful individuals will be trusted more than those who are not but also to the extent that the mere appearance of being trustworthy will enhance the chance of being met with social mindfulness In Study 3 we therefore explored whether seeing a strangers trustworthyas opposed to untrustworthyface would be enough to elicit higher levels of social mindfulness trustworthiness hypothesis In Study 4 we sought further validation by tracing social mindfulness in underlying personality structures We expected social mindfulness to be specifically associated with personality factors that are geared toward enhancing or maintaining the relationship with others like HonestyHumility and Agreeableness personality hypothesis We also tested our expectation that Empathy would be associated with Social Mindfulness empathy hypothesis as well as a prosocial value orientation SVO hypothesis</content></resource></resourceList><clientID>1</clientID></parameters>
