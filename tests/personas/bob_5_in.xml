Our goal was to reconcile how people can promote system ideals such as equal opportunities for all and at the same time recognize that group based disparities are  in part  due to these unfulfilled ideals. Three studies examined whether people perceived a discrepancy between a system s ideal goals and its achievement of those goals. Everyone endorsed these goal ideals more than they believed that the goals were being achieved  however  this discrepancy was larger for low status people. The larger the perceived discrepancy  the more dissatisfied people were with the system and the more likely they were to support hierarchy attenuating policies. Studies 2 and 3 also examined people s motivation for endorsing goal ideals. People of all statuses endorsed system ideals to promote an ideal system more than to legitimize the actual system  Study 2   however  high status people were slightly more likely to endorse system ideals to legitimize the actual system than low status people  Study 3 . In summary  low status people were more likely than high status people to recognize discrepancies between system goals and system outcomes  show dissatisfaction with the American system  and prefer policies that would attenuate extant hierarchies.      The United States is known throughout the world as the  land of opportunity.  One of the main reasons people immigrate to the United States is to live the American dream  acquiring a better education and advancing their economic status through better employment  Hagelskamp  Su rez Orozco    Hughes  2010  Portes   Rumbaut  2001  Su rez Orozco   Su rez Orozco  2001 . However  in reality there are large economic  social  political  educational  and health disparities in American society based on class  race  ethnicity  gender  and sexual orientation. Given these large group based disparities  it is puzzling that America can maintain its reputation as a country that promises economic opportunities and social and political progress. What is even more perplexing is that people of low status  e.g.  immigrants  believe in these ideals and promises of the American dream despite experiencing economic hardships and discrimination firsthand  Kao   Tienda  1995  Phalet  Andriessen    Lens  2004 .    Political scientists describe people s ambivalence about the promise of equality in America. On the one hand  people believe that everyone has a relatively equal chance of getting ahead or improving his or her economic status  but on the other hand  they believe that our political and social systems help perpetuate inequality and that we still have a lot of work to do to eliminate discrimination against marginalized groups  e.g.  Bartels  2008  Hochschild  1981  1995  2006 . Several theories attempt to explain this resilience of faith in the American system. Of particular interest are theories that focus on the endorsement and perpetuation of ideologies that rationalize the status quo. For example  the belief that hard work leads to success  meritocracy  Jost   Banaji  1994  Jost   Hunyady  2003  2005  Jost  Pelham  Sheldon    Sullivan  2003  can explain why some people enjoy a happy and prosperous life and others struggle and live in squalor. This notion that ideologies and beliefs can be powerful tools to maintain social systems has been referred to  for example  as false consciousness  Marx   Engels  1846 1978   cultural hegemony  Gramsci  1971   and legitimizing myths  Sidanius   Pratto  1999 .    One prominent theory that explains why people are motivated to maintain these beliefs is system justification theory. System justification theory states that people are motivated by epistemic  existential  and relational needs to legitimize current social  cultural  economic  and political systems and perceive them as fair and just  Jost   Banaji  1994  Jost  Banaji    Nosek  2004  Jost   Thompson  2000  for similar ideas  see also Kluegel   Smith  1986  McCoy   Major  2007  Sidanius  Pratto    Rabinowitz  1994  Sidanius  Levin  Federico    Pratto  2001 . What is paradoxical and provocative about this research is that although high status members tend to justify the system more than low status members  e.g.  Jost   Thompson  2000  Sidanius   Pratto  1999  Wakslak  Jost  Tyler    Chen  2007   sometimes low status members are just as likely  or more likely than  high status members to endorse system justifying beliefs  Jost et al.  2003 . These findings verify one of the main tenets of system justification theory  that people legitimize the system  even at the expense of personal and or group interests.    Claiming that people of low status justify the status quo is in stark contrast to the numerous examples of low status individuals and groups subtly and openly opposing and defying dominant systems that disadvantage them  which constitute forms of resistance that seem to challenge the legitimacy of the system  see Kelley  1994  Lalonde   Silverman  1994  Miller  Gurin  Gurin    Malanchuk  1981  Scott  1976  1985  Tausch et al.  2011  Wright  Taylor    Moghaddam  1990 . Throughout the world and throughout history  low status groups do at times risk personal freedom and safety to oppose leaders that promote a status quo that keeps them at the bottom. Recently  several powerful and entrenched North African and Middle Eastern governments collapsed as a result of disaffected citizens protesting en masse against status quo governments perceived to be despotic and out of touch with their needs  New York Times  2011 . Even in stable democracies such as the United States  those lower in status push back against a system that marginalizes them. For example  union workers  students  teachers  and the unemployed have occupied Wall Street  and other financial districts across the United States  and expressed their anger toward big business  rising unemployment  home foreclosures  and widespread inequality  New York Times  2012 .    There is an evident contradiction between people s beliefs about what society should achieve and what it actually achieves. Those on the lowest rungs of the social ladder support ideologies that can perpetuate the often imbalanced status quo that exists in America  while simultaneously be dissatisfied with how American systems lead to these unequal outcomes. These inconsistencies suggest that there might be more to the story than low status people endorsing these beliefs as a means to legitimize current inequality. Perhaps there is a rational basis for believing in these normative ideologies that is rooted in different motives than legitimizing the system  see Laurin  Fitzsimons    Kay  2011 . This article investigates the complexities of people s perceptions of society and system legitimacy and provides an additional explanation for why people endorse these ideological beliefs. In so doing  we hope to bridge the seeming contradiction between low status people s endorsement of positive American ideologies and their dissatisfaction with the American system. To better understand these inconsistent patterns  we must first understand the definition and source of legitimacy  the function of ideology  and its divergence with support for the status quo.       The Meaning and Functions of Ideology   Definitions of the term ideology focus on the shared beliefs about prescriptive and descriptive social arrangements. For example  Jost  Federico  and Napier  2009  see also Denzau   North  2000  Erikson   Tedin  2003  defined ideology as People use ideology  as defined above  to explain and make sense of society s outcomes  Feldman  1988  Feldman   Steenbergen  2001  Goren  2004  Jost  Glaser  Kruglanski    Sulloway  2003a  2003b   as well as to describe how society should be structured and operate in the future  Kay et al.  2009 . Although many agree that ideology represents core beliefs that can help define one s values regarding a system and establish the legitimacy of a system  social scientists have been criticized for focusing on the  actual social relations rather than ideal ones   Beetham  1991  p. 6 . Perhaps emphasizing only one function of ideology  i.e.  to legitimize inequality  has led to an oversimplified story about why people endorse these beliefs and an inability to  understand the legitimacy of the modern state  or distinguish where it is  from where it is not  legitimate   Beetham  1991  p. 6 .    an endeavor to describe or interpret the world as it is by making assertions or assumptions about human nature  historical events  present realities  and future possibilities and to envision the world as it should be  specifying acceptable means of attaining social  economic  and political ideals.  p. 309       Defining Legitimacy  Congruence of Prescriptive and Descriptive Ideological Beliefs   Baba loved the idea of America. It was living in America that gave him an ulcer.    Khaled Hosseini  The Kite Runner   There are two types of beliefs that must be considered simultaneously to know whether people legitimize their systems  Beetham  1991  Habermas  1979  Moore  1978 . Prescriptive beliefs refer to the acceptability of certain ideals being pursued by a system  and descriptive beliefs refer to the extent that people perceive current outcomes as reflecting the actual achievement or attainment of these ideals  see also Major  Kaiser  O Brien    McCoy  2007  Son Hing et al.  2011 . In other words  prescriptive beliefs represent the abstract values that citizens of a society want to strive for and achieve or how they believe society should work  e.g.  hard work should lead to success . Descriptive beliefs refer to the extent to which these values are perceived as actually reflecting society and whether society actually works as intended  e.g.  hard work does lead to success . As the quote above implies  prescriptive and descriptive beliefs about a system are often independent  if not at odds.    We suggest that only to the extent that there is a correspondence between prescriptive and descriptive beliefs is there evidence of legitimacy. Zelditch  2001  asserted that  belief in something is different from using that belief to justify that something else is  right    Zelditch  2001  p. 48 . People may agree with how a system should operate but not necessarily agree that a system is operating as it should or is producing fair outcomes  see Son Hing et al.  2011  When a group goal is not achieved  this may lead to a legitimacy deficit  Beetham  1991  or to the delegitimization of a system  Kelman  2001  Linz  1978 . Thus  people might agree with a certain ideology because it describes how they think the system should operate  but once they see that the current system is not working the way it should  they may perceive injustice and resist the system  Moore  1978  Scott  1976  1985  or possibly devalue the ideology  see Levy  Freitas  Mendoza Denton    Kugelmass  2006 . For example  people may endorse a criminal justice system that  in the abstract  protects all residents equally while simultaneously be dissatisfied with the reality that in our criminal justice system  people of color face systematic discrimination. The degree to which these beliefs are congruent may influence attitudes and behaviors quite differently leading a populace into complacency or toward revolution  see Taylor   McKirnan  1984 .    There is some research that examines the degree to which people s prescriptive and descriptive beliefs match. This evidence indicates that when motivated to justify a system  due to system dependence  system inescapability  or system threat   people are more likely to perceive the current state of affairs as more ideal  i.e.  they  injunctify  the system  than those who are less motivated  Kay et al.  2009 . However  examining the mean ratings of system ideals showed that  across the board  participants favored equal over unequal systems regardless of their motivation or the way that the system was initially framed. This pattern suggests that although a system justification motive may influence evaluations of system legitimacy  people s perception of ideal systems are driven more by desires for equality than by the  often unequal  status quo. This conclusion was especially the case when the participants were members of the group that was disadvantaged by system inequality  Kay et al.  2009  Studies 3 and 4  see also Jost   Kay  2005  Studies 1 and 2  Sidanius   Pratto  1999 . In short  injuctification of unequal systems might be less likely for those low than high in status. Thus  in the current article  we also examine whether the correspondence between prescriptive and descriptive beliefs is moderated by group status  e.g.  income and socioeconomic status .       Using Status to Predict the Different Functions of Ideology   Although most Americans accept prescriptive beliefs about equality  meritocracy  and democracy  they may differ widely in their descriptive beliefs. Because prescriptive principles may not  or do not  come to fruition for members of low status groups  these people in particular might not believe in the descriptive manifestations of these ideologies     It is clear that a radical critique of existing arrangements may arise in virtually any subordinate class that takes the dominant ideology to heart and  at the same time  penetrates in daily life the realities that betray or ignore the implicit promises of that ideology.  Scott  1985  p. 339    If people of high and low status differ in their descriptive beliefs  then they may have different motivations for endorsing prescriptive beliefs. To the extent that people perceive system outcomes as reflecting ideological goals  they may use prescriptive ideological beliefs as a means to legitimize the status quo. For example  people who believe that hard work does lead to success might be more likely to use the prescriptive ideology of meritocracy to rationalize why some people are successful and others are not.    Conversely  to the extent that people recognize that outcomes are not conforming to normative ideals  they may be motivated to reinforce prescriptive beliefs  not because they want to legitimize current inequality  but because they hope that by pushing for higher ideological standards  one day those goals can be achieved. In other words  they may strategically use prescriptive beliefs in an effort to change the status quo which suggests a different utility of ideology for those in different social strata. This distinction can only be revealed when one considers both prescriptive and descriptive beliefs. Thus  low status people may be less likely to endorse descriptive beliefs of ideologies than high status people  see Crocker   Major  1989  Fox   Ferri  1992   however  low status people may still endorse prescriptive beliefs  perhaps even more strongly than high status people  in an effort to bring the system more in line with these ideals.    Not only can people s perceptions about legitimacy  as defined by the congruence between prescriptive and descriptive beliefs  determine the function of ideology  but they can also determine people s satisfaction with different systems and influence whether people support policies aimed at achieving the abstract ideological goals of a system. If people believe that a goal has already been achieved  i.e.  descriptive beliefs   then they will be more satisfied with the system and less likely to support policies that promote changes to the system  Hochschild  2006 .       Overview of Studies   The purpose of Studies 1 3 was to examine people s perceptions of how society actually operates  descriptive beliefs  and whether these views are congruent with or divergent from their views of what should be occurring in society  prescriptive beliefs . We are particularly interested in investigating whether people s status influences these perceptions. We predicted that people of all statuses would endorse the abstract goals of ideologies  i.e.  prescriptive beliefs  but would be less likely to endorse beliefs that this is how society actually functions  i.e.  descriptive beliefs   resulting in a main effect of beliefs. We also expected that this discrepancy between prescriptive and descriptive beliefs would be larger for low status individuals than high status individuals  resulting in an interaction between status and beliefs.    We expected that status would independently predict satisfaction with the system  arguably a more direct measure of system justification  and support for policies that maintain existing hierarchies. However  we predicted that the discrepancy between prescriptive and descriptive beliefs would be the strongest predictor of dissatisfaction with the system and support for policies designed to change the system  Studies 1 3 . We expected that perceived discrepancy would function similarly regardless of status  and therefore did not predict that these would interact to predict satisfaction and policy preferences.    We also expected that high  and low status participants would endorse prescriptive ideological beliefs for different reasons. Those of high status would be more likely to endorse the prescriptive beliefs to perpetuate the existing system. Conversely  those of low status would endorse these beliefs in an effort to transform the system  Studies 2 and 3 . Similarly  we expected that those who perceive less of a discrepancy between prescriptive and descriptive beliefs would endorse prescriptive beliefs to perpetuate the existing system  but those that perceive more of a discrepancy would endorse prescriptive ideologies in an effort to transform the system.       Study 1   Study 1 examined the extent to which people of high and low status endorse the abstract goals of American ideologies  prescriptive beliefs  and whether or not they believed that these goals were being attained  descriptive beliefs . Participants rated the extent to which they endorse the prescriptive and descriptive beliefs of equality  meritocracy  and democracy. We selected ideologies that have been used in prior work on system justification and legitimizing myths  equality  Jost   Thompson  2000  Sidanius   Pratto  1999   meritocracy  sometimes referred to as Protestant work ethic  Jost   Hunyady  2003  Quinn   Crocker  1999   and democracy  Manwell  2010 . We predicted that everyone would perceive a discrepancy between prescriptive and descriptive ideological beliefs  a main effect of beliefs   but that this pattern would be more pronounced for low status than high status individuals  a belief by status interaction . Specifically  low status members should be just as  or more likely than  high status members to endorse the prescriptive ideological beliefs  however  low status members should be less likely than high status members to endorse the descriptive beliefs.    Participants also rated the extent to which they were satisfied with America and would support federal spending to better the conditions for low status groups. We expected that satisfaction would be lower and support for hierarchy attenuating policies would be higher among low status members and for those who perceived a larger discrepancy between prescriptive and descriptive beliefs.</content></resource><resource><rank>0.165720</rank><id>2</id><content>Contrary to those of adults and adolescents  children s value structures and value preferences have rarely been investigated. This paper bridges this gap by building on Schwartz s  1992  value theory. We present two studies  one in which children from Germany  Portugal  and Chile  aged 10 to 12 years  completed the Portrait Values Questionnaire  Schwartz et al.  2001   and one in which children from Germany and France  aged 7 to 12 years  completed the Picture Based Value Survey for Children  D ring  Blauensteiner  Aryus  Dr gekamp    Bilsky  2010 . Theory based multidimensional scaling analyses revealed differentiated value structures in both studies. Findings on children s value preferences converged with evidence from adult samples  Schwartz   Bardi  2001 . The results are discussed in light of the present state of knowledge and consequences for future research.      Empirical research on human values has grown rapidly over the past few decades  e.g.  Hofstede  1980  Inglehart  1977  Rokeach  1973  Schwartz  1992 . One of the most fruitful theories on the content and structure of human values   one that has also proved to be a conceptually and empirically appropriate and sound approach for cross cultural investigations   was developed by Schwartz  1992 . Schwartz conceives values as transsituational concepts or beliefs about desirable goals that vary in importance and serve as guiding principles in people s lives. With respect to their content  values can be distinguished on the basis of the motivational goals they express. Schwartz derives ten motivationally distinct basic values  see Table 1  second column .   Graphic Table 1   These basic values are dynamically related and show a circular structure  which results because the behavioral implications of individual values are either compatible or incompatible with each other. This suggests that the closer any two basic values are located around the circle  the more compatible they are. The ten basic values can be aggregated so as to form four higher order values  HOV . These HOVs represent opposing poles of two roughly orthogonal dimensions  self enhancement versus self transcendence and openness to change versus conservation. The assignment of basic to HOVs is shown in Table 1  see Schwartz  2005 .    The universality of this structure was confirmed in hundreds of studies with samples from all over the world  e.g.  Bilsky  Janik    Schwartz  2011  Schwartz  1994  2006  2007  Schwartz   Sagiv  1995 . In addition  research revealed universal patterns for value preferences. For example  a pancultural value hierarchy appears to lie hidden behind the obvious differences between cultures  All over the world  people consider values of benevolence and universalism important  but values of power unimportant  Schwartz  2006  2007  Schwartz   Bardi  2001 . Furthermore  women tend to find values of self transcendence and conservation more important than men  whereas men tend to find values of self enhancement and openness to change more important than women  Schwartz   Rubel  2005 . It seems reasonable to assume that the ground for these and other cross cultural patterns is laid in early childhood.    Surprisingly  however  only a few studies have addressed values in adolescence  e.g.  Barni   Knafo  2012  Daniel et al.  2012  Knafo   Schwartz  2003   only a handful of studies have reported findings on values in late childhood  i.e.  ca. 10 to 12 years  Boehnke   Welzel  2006  Bubeck   Bilsky  2004  D ring  2010  Knafo   Spinath  2011   and there is hardly any research at all on values of children under 10 years of age  Cieciuch  Harasimczuk    D ring  2010  D ring  Blauensteiner  Aryus  Dr gekamp    Bilsky  2010 . Although evidence on the content and structure of human values at this early age is scarce so far  the existing findings encourage researchers to further follow this path  Bubeck and Bilsky  2004   Cieciuch et al.  2010   D ring  2010   and D ring et al.  2010  found highly differentiated value structures in childhood  which indicate that children basically structure values the same way adults do.    Even though this finding is intriguing in view of traditional values research  it can be embedded in recent developmental theories  e.g.  Eder   Mangelsdorf  1997  Thompson  Meyer    McGinley  2006 . Thompson et al.  2006   for instance  point to a reconceptualization of the child s role in the process of value transmission  While traditional approaches portrayed the child in line with Piaget and Kohlberg as a preconventional and egocentric thinker who reacts to the incentives and sanctions provided by adults  recent approaches portray the child as an  intuitive moralist   Thompson et al.  2006  p. 290  who is sensitive to standards and who develops a differentiated conception of desires  intentions  and rules. Thus  the child s own conscious representation of values gradually moved to the focus of interest. Likewise  it is often stated that children s ability to provide meaningful information by themselves has been historically underestimated  e.g.  Morris  Robinson    Eisenberg  2006 . Numerous recent studies revealed surprisingly differentiated structures within children s self concepts after researchers succeeded in developing suitable procedures for obtaining information directly from the child. While studying various aspects of children s self concept  researchers discovered clear structures in early childhood which progressively differentiate as children grow older  see Eder  1990  for pioneering work in this respect  for an overview  see Measelle  John  Ablow  Cowan    Cowan  2005 . However  empirical evidence of how children conceive values is still widely missing.    This contrasts with the fact that children s values are a highly prominent issue in politics and education worldwide 1. A better understanding of how children structure values  i.e.  how they understand and attach meaning to individual values in relation to one another  and of which values children find important  i.e.  children s value preferences  will help us to build a solid basis for both scientists and practitioners in this area. We believe that the child s own report is of particular importance for understanding his her value preferences and value structures. It reveals information not otherwise accessible that cannot be replaced by any other source such as the primary caregiver  see Morris et al.  2006 .    In this article  we assess children s values through self report. We replicate and validate the findings from previous studies and expand their cultural scope. The most critical issue so far concerned the question about how researchers can successfully obtain data from children. Findings by Bubeck and Bilsky  2004  as well as by D ring  2010  indicate that the most widely used questionnaire based on Schwartz s framework  the Portrait Values Questionnaire  PVQ 21  Schwartz et al.  2001   can be successfully completed by children over the age of 10 if an adult instructor provides continuous assistance. By the age of 10 years  however  a critical threshold seems to have been reached  see D ring  2010 . In order to follow the development and shaping of values through childhood  D ring et al.  2010  introduced a new questionnaire for elementary school aged children that was specifically suited to children s literary and life context  the Picture Based Value Survey for Children  PBVS C .    Focusing in particular on the critical age of 10 years  we present findings on value structures and value preferences from different cultures. In Study 1  10  to 12 year old children from Germany  Portugal  and Chile completed Schwartz et al. s PVQ. Germany  Portugal  and Chile represent culturally diverse life contexts  which  however  do not differ enormously with respect to the cultural values transmitted from one generation to the next  Schwartz  2006 . In Study 2  7  to 12 year old children from Germany and France completed D ring et al. s PBVS C. The cultural life contexts in Germany and France differ somewhat  e.g.  France is more oriented toward intellectual autonomy  whereas Germany is more oriented toward egalitarianism  Schwartz  2006 . However  by and large  they are not very different in their underlying cultural value orientations.    Back to Top   Study 1  Assessment of Children s Values with the PVQ   Our first study was to serve as a comprehensive replication of the study conducted by Bubeck and Bilsky  2004   who were among the first to explore value structures in adolescence. They analyzed data obtained with an earlier version of Schwartz s PVQ  the PVQ 29  Schwartz   from 1 555 German subjects aged 10 to 17 years. They found that value structures in the youngest subsample  10 12 years  were almost as differentiated as those in the oldest subsample  15 17 years . In order to substantiate this finding  we collected further data from 10  to 12 year old German children using the PVQ 21  the most recent and most widely employed version  e.g.  see http   www.europeansocialsurvey.org   and complemented this data with data from Portugal and Chile.2 We expected to obtain similar findings on value structures and value preferences in these three countries due to shared European  Germany and Portugal  and Christian roots.    Back to Top   Method   Back to Top   Samples   All samples cover a wide range of children s socioeconomic and educational backgrounds  although they are not strictly representative. The data were collected in schools  the survey was administered in class  with a trained researcher giving the children the instructions.    Back to Top   German Sample   The data were collected in both rural and urban areas of two federal states of Germany  North Rhine Westphalia and Baden Wuerttemberg. There were 1 096 participants  schoolchildren from the four different types of secondary school in Germany  comprehensive school  grammar school  and two types of secondary school . The participants were aged 10 to 12  M   11.1  SD   0.72   the sample was almost evenly split between males  n   561  and females  n   535 .    Back to Top   Portuguese Sample   The data were collected at one school in Lisbon  two schools near Lisbon  and at another school in Lamego  a small city about 300 km to the north of Lisbon. One of the schools near Lisbon was private  attended by 281 of the participants   all the others were public schools. Altogether  456 Portuguese students  247 boys and 209 girls  aged 10 to 12  M   11.0  SD   0.74  participated in this study.    Back to Top   Chilean Sample   The data were collected in two large Chilean cities  Los Angeles  n   226  with about 100 000 inhabitants and Puerto Montt  n   424  with about 150 000 inhabitants. A group of 650 Chilean schoolchildren  312 boys and 338 girls  aged 10 to 12  M   11.0  SD   0.78  participated in our study. About half of the participants attended public schools  n   335  and the other half private schools  n   315 .    Back to Top   Value Survey   A short form of Schwartz s Portrait Values Questionnaire  Schwartz et al.  2001  was used in Study 1. This form comprises vignettes with verbal portraits of 21 different people  PVQ 21 . Each of them describes a person s goals as specified by Schwartz s theory  see Table 1 . The following example is indicative of self direction   Thinking up new ideas and being creative is important to her him. S he likes to do things in her his own original way.  Answers to the question  How much is this person like you   are to be given for each vignette on a 6 point scale  1   very much like me and 6   not at all like me .    Back to Top   Data Analysis   Back to Top   Structural Analyses   Pearson correlation coefficient matrices from the responses to the 21 PVQ items provided the basis for our structural analyses of values  which were conducted using ordinal multidimensional scaling  MDS . MDS has been a central tool of psychological research on value structure in the past  and it is usually used in an exploratory way. Contrary to this practice  our MDS approach uses a starting configuration derived from theoretical considerations. This reduces the danger of local minima and facilitates a theoretically grounded interpretation of results  Borg   Groenen  2005  Borg   Staufenbiel  2007 .    Recent analyses of value data from the European Social Survey showed that Schwartz s original and his revised model of value structures  Schwartz  1992  pp. 14 and 45  respectively  can be considered theoretically equivalent alternatives supported by empirical research  Bilsky   Janik  2010b  Bilsky et al.  2011 3. Therefore  we chose the more parsimonious original model with ten adjacent value sectors as the starting configuration for the following analyses  as was done for previous analyses of value structures at an early age  see D ring  2010  D ring et al.  2010 . This was accomplished by specifying trigonometrically the prototypical location of each basic value by corresponding coordinates in two dimensional space  Table 1  Columns 4 6  see Bilsky et al.  2008  Bilsky   Janik  2010a . The starting configuration for each of the value items of Schwartz s Portrait Values Questionnaire results from these coordinates  Items that are indicators of the same basic value are represented by identical coordinates. Ordinal multidimensional scaling was performed using SPSS PROXSCAL and SYSTAT 12.</content></resource><resource><rank>0.149167</rank><id>6</id><content>   Abstract   This research project was undertaken in response to Kluger and DeNisi s  1996  call for more primary studies to investigate specific propositions of the feedback intervention theory  FIT . To study the assumptions of FIT on the level of task motivation processes  we analyzed the impact of combined positive and negative feedback. Participants  N   413  performed a series of tasks in which they were to indicate the number of athletes appearing in short video sequences of different sports. After each task performance the participants received manipulated feedback and were to choose between predetermined options  e.g.  raise the level of difficulty  maintain the level of difficulty . We found that the participants most frequently raised the difficulty level after receiving positive feedback and maintained the level after receiving negative feedback. There were no significant differences in the performance of participants who raised and those who maintained the difficulty level after receiving positive or negative feedback. However  the performance of participants who raised the difficulty level after receiving positive feedback increased more than that of those who maintained the difficulty level after receiving negative feedback. In addition  we observed an increase in participants  avoidance behavior in response to repeated negative feedback. The results partially confirmed the assumptions of the FIT.      The influence of feedback on human behavior is extensive. Various studies have shown the impact of feedback on different behavioral aspects  such as motivation  e.g.  Butler   Nisan  1986  Deci  Koestner    Ryan  1999  Jussim  Soffin  Brown  Ley    Kohlhepp  1992  Narciss  2004   learning  e.g.  Black   Wiliam  1998  Goodman   Wood  2004  Narciss   Huth  2004  Pashler  Cepeda  Wixted    Rohrer  2005  Wulf  Shea    Lewthwaite  2010   and goal orientation  e.g.  Cron  Slocum  VandeWalle    Fu  2005  Phillips  Hollenbeck    Ilgen  1996  Senko   Harackiewicz  2005  VandeWalle  Cron    Slocum  2001 . Feedback allows one to compare the actual state with the target state and discover a discrepancy between actual and desired achievement. Thus  it enables one to evaluate one s previous performance in relation to a specific goal or standard. The perception of a possible discrepancy influences subsequent performance.    Feedback information can originate from external sources  e.g.  teacher  or internal sources  information derived by task processing itself  e.g.  proprioceptive perceptions in a motor task   Butler   Winne  1995  Magill  2001  Narciss  2008 . In line with this notion  Narciss  2008  suggested the existence of two feedback loops  one that involved the comparison of internal feedback to an internal reference value derived from a subjective estimation of task demands and another that involved the comparison of external feedback to an external reference value mainly derived from external information  i.e.  instructional goals . Thus  external feedback loops may correspond or conflict with internal feedback loops. Both processes interact and together determine the impact of feedback. In particular  Butler and Winne  1995  called attention to the significant role of internal feedback in enabling self regulated learning  where a high amount of self regulation is tied to an effective and economic learning process. Such learners monitor themselves and their process of engagement by creating and analyzing internal feedback  see also Hattie  2002 . Thus  external feedback primarily assists the perception of discrepancies between the internally represented actual and target state. It represents additional information confirming or moderating internal feedback and may help the learner to successfully execute self regulated learning  Butler   Winne  1995  Ilgen   Davis  2000  Narciss  2008 .    Numerous studies  see Bangert Drowns  Kulik  Kulik    Morgan  1991  Hattie   Timperley  2007  Kluger   DeNisi  1996  Mason   Bruning  2001  Mory  2004  Narciss  2008  Shute  2008  have revealed conflicting findings where feedback could have a positive  negative  or even a debilitating effect on performance. For example  Shute  2008  pointed out that despite a large amount of feedback research  many conflicting and minor findings continue to exist. So far  several theoretical frameworks have been proposed and adopted that specifically try to explain these controversial feedback effects  e.g.  Bangert Drowns et al.  1991  Butler   Winne  1995  Hattie   Timperley  2007  Mason   Bruning  2001  Narciss  2008 . The feedback intervention theory  FIT   developed by Kluger and DeNisi  1996   is one of the most important of these theories. The authors called for more primary studies to investigate specific propositions of their theory. This research paper is a response to this call. To study the assumptions of FIT with respect to task motivation processes  we examined the immediate influence of possible combinations of positive and negative feedback  consistent and inconsistent  on task performance and goal setting.    Back to Top   The Feedback Intervention Theory  FIT    The FIT  Kluger   DeNisi  1996  is based on the assumption that behavior is regulated by comparisons of feedback to goals or standards that are organized hierarchically. The authors distinguished three hierarchical levels at which the impact of feedback on performance differs  task learning processes  task motivation processes  and meta task processes. Attention is usually directed to the intermediate level of the hierarchy  task motivation processes   whereas specific feedback interventions can change the locus of attention. Therefore  the style of feedback plays a crucial role in regulating human performance  Brunot  Huguet    Monteil  2000  Lipnevich   Smith  2009  Podsakoff   Fahr  1989  Shute  2008  Venables   Fairclough  2009 . For example  feedback focused on the details of a task  e.g.  information about the position of one s fingers when one is learning to play the guitar  directs one s attention to the level of task learning processes. Additional information about the appropriate handling of a specific task facilitates the learning process. Hence  the feedback recipient can use this information to improve his or her performance  Butler   Winne  1995 . Numerous studies confirmed this assumption  Feedback has been found to have more influence when details about how to improve performance are provided  Hattie  2002  Hattie   Timperley  2007  Lipnevich   Smith  2009  Magill  2001  Narciss   Huth  2004 .    On the level of task motivation processes  feedback is at first compared to the individual task standard. If a positive feedback standard discrepancy is revealed  the person has the opportunity to pursue other goals. Depending on the occurrence of such an opportunity  the person either raises the standard and increases his her effort or maintains the standard and reduces his her effort  see Bandura  1991  1997  Erez  2005  Hattie  2002  Ilies   Judge  2005  Locke   Latham  1990  McCalley  de Vries    Midden  2011  Phillips et al.  1996 . However  if the feedback standard discrepancy is negative  participant s effort increases. If the subsequent outcome is attained by a reduction in discrepancy  the FIT further suggests that participant s effort increases or is at least maintained  see Cron et al.  2005  Hattie  2002  Ilgen   Davis  2000 . If no reduction in discrepancy can be achieved  attention is either directed toward the level of task learning processes or toward the level of meta task processes  depending on the individual s belief in success.    Feedback that is related to the self  such as explicitly positive or explicitly negative feedback  directs one s attention to the level of meta task processes. Even feedback that contradicted participants  performance history  e.g.  positive feedback for low achievers  was shown to enhance self focused attention  Brunot et al.  2000 . On this level  negative feedback motivates people to reduce the feedback standard discrepancy. Therefore  one possibility is to redirect attention to the task motivation processes and to attempt to improve performance. An easier alternative is to withdraw from the task and engage in other activities  Hattie  2002  Ilgen   Davis  2000  Klein  1997  Pulfrey  Buchs    Butera  2011  Venables   Fairclough  2009 . In this case  performance declines. The main aim at this level is to protect oneself from repeated negative feedback and to attain a positive self image. Ilgen and Davies  2000  emphasized that repeated negative feedback lowers expectations and therefore makes avoidance behavior more probable. Thus  decisions like quitting or choosing a higher task difficulty represent an opportunity to protect one s self image. Raising the level of difficulty diminishes the relevance of repeated negative feedback due to the knowledge of the increased difficulty of the task. Furthermore  the negative feedback is attributed more to the task complexity than to one s own failure.    Kluger and DeNisi  1996  pointed out that their three level hierarchy is an abstraction. They assumed that the hierarchy could be more complex and contain more sublevels. Moreover  it seemed possible that these levels interact with each other  and attention is directed to each level to varying degrees. Therefore  a specific feedback intervention could lead to more than one feedback standard comparison. In addition  the possible discrepancies could be weighted and integrated into an overall reaction to the feedback. Figure 1 summarizes the basic assumptions of the FIT.   Graphic Figure 1   Back to Top   Previous Research on the Impact of Feedback on the Relationship Between Goal Setting and Performance   Feedback research has shown that feedback mostly increased performance  see Bangert Drowns et al.  1991  Hattie   Timperley  2007  Mason   Bruning  2001  Mory  2004  Narciss  2008  Shute  2008 . However  Kluger and DeNisi  1996  revealed in their meta analysis that at least one third of the included studies reported decreasing effects  see also Ilgen   Davis  2000 . According to these results  not only the style of feedback  but also the specificity of goals  e.g.  Erez  2005  Hattie   Timperley  2007  Ilies   Judge  2005  McCalley et al.  2011  VandeWalle et al.  2001  and the characteristics of the task  e.g.  DeShon   Alexander  1996  Hattie   Timperley  2007  Magill  2001  Vancouver   Tischner  2004  have been identified as important factors that moderate feedback effects. The biggest influence on performance may be expected when performing a low difficulty task and goals are attainable  clear  and specific  see DeShon   Alexander  1996  Ilgen   Davis  2000  Kluger   DeNisi  1996 . Previously  Erez  1977  demonstrated that feedback had a significant impact on goal setting and pointed out its role in the relationship between goal setting and performance  Carver   Scheier  1981  Cron et al.  2005  Erez  2005 . Goals represent levels of performance that are attained by individuals. Hence  they enable a person to evaluate his her actions and efforts  Locke   Latham  1990 . Therefore  feedback is necessary for evaluating discrepancies between selected goals and actual achievement by showing one s progress toward the goal. It seems helpful to adjust effort  achievement  strategies  or tactics to meet the target  but also to set reasonable goals. In this regard  it was shown that not only does goal setting affect the impact of feedback but that feedback influences subsequent goal setting  Cron et al.  2005 . Positive feedback was found to enhance recipients  decision to set more difficult goals  whereas negative feedback resulted in a tendency for them to lower their goals  Donovan   Williams  2003  Ilies   Judge  2005  Phillips et al.  1996  Tolli   Schmidt  2008  VandeWalle et al.  2001  Williams  Donovan    Dodge  2000  see also Ilies  Judge    Wagner  2010 . The setting of more difficult goals after receiving positive feedback is tied to social cognitive theory  Bandura  1997   according to which individuals create positive discrepancies  set higher goals than in previous task performances  and try to succeed  as long as they assess the more difficult goals as attainable. Indeed  more difficult goals go along with a lower probability of success but nevertheless greater stimulation by reaching this goal at a higher level of performance  Bandura  1997  Kluger   DeNisi  1996 . On the other hand  creating less challenging goals increases the probability of success. Thus  the chance to rebuild or maintain one s self concept is augmented  Baumeister  1996  Hattie  2002  Kluger   DeNisi  1996  Vancouver   Tischner  2004 . In addition  Klein  1997  demonstrated that normative positive feedback   as opposed to normative negative feedback   enhanced participants  decision to persevere instead of switching to another task. However  these results have to be interpreted carefully considering the individual s assessment of feedback  Podsakoff and Fahr  1989  demonstrated that feedback credibility mediated the relationship between feedback and goal setting as well as performance.    Back to Top   Aims of the Current Study   This study examines the assumptions of the FIT on the level of task motivation processes. Kluger and DeNisi  1996  presumed that changes in achievement and goal setting occur as a result of both positive and negative feedback standard discrepancies. The following hypotheses were deduced  In contrast to positive feedback  raising the standard after receiving negative feedback offers the possibility of decreasing the relevance of repeated negative feedback due to awareness of the increased level of difficulty. Therefore  our next hypotheses were  The FIT assumes an increase in performance when raising the standard after receiving positive feedback or maintaining the standard after receiving negative feedback. As an additional approach and a possible expansion of FIT  we were interested in a comparison of both scenarios.    H1  Following positive feedback  participants raise their standard more often than following negative feedback.    H2  Participants who raise their standard after receiving positive feedback enhance their performance more than participants who maintain their standard after receiving positive feedback.    H3  In the negative feedback condition  participants who practice or maintain their standard enhance their performance more than those who raise their standard.    H4  Repeated negative feedback causes avoidance behavior more often than a single reception of negative feedback.    H5  Participants who raise their standard after receiving positive feedback show an improvement in performance equal to that of participants who maintain their standard after receiving negative feedback.    Back to Top   Method   Back to Top   Participants   The study was conducted at the University of Vienna  Austria  with 413 students  247 female  166 male  participating in exchange for course credit. The participants were students of sports science  n   242  and psychology  n   171 . The average age of the participants was 21.90  SD   3.42  years  ranging from 18 to 43. Data collection took place from November 2009 to April 2010.    Back to Top   Application of the Feedback Intervention Theory   To investigate the impact of positive and negative feedback on performance and goal setting  a computer assisted adaptation of the FIT was constructed. Figure 2 illustrates the configuration schematically. Overall  a task was performed three times and manipulated feedback was presented after the first two task performances. After receiving feedback  participants were asked to choose between predetermined options. Thus  two feedback loops were created in which the impact of feedback on goal setting and performance could be tested  The feedback received after the first time the task was performed allowed us to analyze the impact of feedback on subsequent goal setting and on task performance when the task was performed the second time  first feedback loop . The second feedback loop included the feedback received after the second time the task was performed  subsequent goal setting  and task performance when the task was performed the third time.   Graphic Figure 2   Back to Top   Feedback Conditions   The study was limited to investigating the impact of positive and negative feedback standard discrepancies. Therefore  the manipulation of feedback was appropriate. The feedback interventions used were either positive or negative  irrespective of actual performance. Before performing the task  participants received information concerning the expected average performance on the subsequent task  e.g.  average performance represents a correct response to eight out of 15 items . This information was given to establish a standard of performance. Feedback interventions were based on this standard  In the negative feedback condition  participants were told that they had given two or three correct responses  and that their performance was very below average. In the positive feedback condition  participants were told that they had given 13 or 14 correct answers  and that their performance was very above average. Providing negative or positive feedback after the first two task performances resulted in four different feedback conditions. In the first condition  participants received positive feedback twice  positive positive   in the second  they received negative feedback twice  negative negative . Participants in the third condition received negative feedback after performing the first task and positive feedback after performing the second task  negative positive . In the fourth condition  participants received positive feedback after the first task performance and negative feedback after the second task  positive negative .    Back to Top   Task Performance   To investigate the impact of feedback on performance  we chose a task to measure selective attention. The importance of selective attention for several cognitive performance parameters  e.g.  concentration  memory  perceptual speed  and the possibility of an economical and less time consuming measurement prompted this decision. The items represented short videoclips showing different kinds of sports that had been selected from television broadcasts. The participants  task was to indicate the number of athletes appearing in each clip by pressing the corresponding number key on the computer keyboard. The number of athletes shown ranged from four to nine. The difficulty was to distinguish between active athletes  referees  and substitutes as well as offcourt viewers. Moreover  the duration of the presented videoclips was very short  1 941 ms  and the reaction time was limited  2 000 ms . After the participant s reaction or after time had elapsed  the next videoclip was started. The duration of 1 941 ms resulted from specific characteristics of the software programs for editing and presenting the videoclips. Two tasks were devised  both consisting of 15 items. In previous studies  the internal consistency of both tasks was Cronbach s  alpha    .78. Based on tetrachoric correlation  a split half reliability of r   .90 was achieved. The correlation of the tasks was r   .82. Because of the demand of performing three different tasks in the computer modulation of the FIT  the first task was repeated at the end of the second feedback loop.    Back to Top   Goal Setting   After the first and second feedback intervention  participants were asked to choose between predetermined options. These options were deduced from the task motivation processes of FIT and differed with respect to type  negative or positive  and loop of feedback. There were five options to choose from  whereas three alternatives were presented continuously  maintain the standard  raise the standard  and abort. Maintaining the standard meant choosing a task with the same difficulty level. Raising the standard meant increasing the difficulty level  Participants were told that the following task would be more difficult than the previous one and that the task standard would be higher. This information was simulated  all participants performed the same task in the second feedback loop. This deception was necessary to compare task performance with respect to different decision behaviors. The third option  which was always presented  was to abort the task. An additional alternative was provided in the negative feedback condition  practice and maintain the standard. Participants who chose this option received an additional sequence of three trial items in which immediate feedback for correct answers was presented. Afterwards they were to perform a task with the same level of difficulty. In the repeated negative feedback condition  participants were also given the chance to perform an alternative task  which was a short pair based game. This alternative was offered to introduce the additional possibility of handling repeated negative feedback in contrast to aborting the task.    Back to Top   Procedure   The experiment was conducted under laboratory conditions and for each participant separately. Depending on when they arrived at the laboratory  participants were assigned to one of four feedback conditions. In the run up to the experiment  participants were told that the research was about the development of a task to measure selective attention. After being welcomed  the participants were asked to provide informed consent to participate in the study. The following task was performed on a computer. Participants were told to follow the instructions on the screen. During the experiment  a supervisor stayed in the laboratory to assist with problems or answer participants  questions. At the end of the semester  the actual research objective was revealed to the participants.    Back to Top   Results   Back to Top   Statistical Analysis   Pearson s chi square tests   chi    were conducted to compare goal setting behavior in different feedback conditions. The assumption of an expected cell count of at least five was met consistently. To investigate the effect of the chosen options on achievement  we carried out repeated measures analyses of variance  ANOVA . The sums of correct reactions for each task were included as dependent within subjects variables. The chosen options were used as between subjects factors. The assumptions of repeated measures ANOVA were met and are not specifically reported. Statistical significance in all cases was p   .05.    Back to Top   The First Feedback Loop   Two conditions were analyzed in the first feedback loop. After performing the first task  participants in two feedback conditions  NN and NP  received negative feedback  while those in the other two conditions  PP and PN  received positive feedback. Table 1 shows the frequency of the chosen options with respect to the feedback condition. To examine the first hypothesis  the options  maintain standard  and  practice and maintain standard  in the negative feedback condition were collapsed. One participant aborted the task and was excluded from further data analysis. Pearson s chi square test of the 2   2 contingency table revealed a significant difference between the two conditions   chi     212.86  df   1  p   .001 . After receiving positive feedback  84.5  of the participants raised their standard  whereas only 12.7  chose this option after receiving negative feedback. Thus  Hypothesis 1 was confirmed  Participants who received positive feedback raised their difficulty level significantly more often than those who received negative feedback.   Graphic Table 1   A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted for the positive and the negative feedback conditions separately to test Hypotheses 2 and 3. In the positive feedback condition  we assumed that participants raising the standard would show a greater increase in performance than those maintaining the standard. Repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant effect of performance in both tasks  F 1  205    44.91  p   .001   eta 2   .18  but no significant interaction between performance and the chosen option  F 1  205    .79  p   .375. Differences in time between participants raising the standard and those maintaining the standard were not significant. The between subjects effect was significant  F 1  205    12.85  p   .001   eta 2   .059. It should be noted that  due to the unequal number of participants raising versus maintaining the standard after receiving positive feedback  the results of repeated measures ANOVA have to be interpreted carefully. Hypothesis 2 had to be rejected. In the negative feedback condition  we hypothesized that participants practicing or maintaining their standard would enhance their performance more than those raising the standard. There were no significant differences in performance between participants selecting different options  F 2  202    .27  p   .766  and there was no significant interaction between the chosen options and task performance  F 2  202    2.47  p   .087. The effect of performance of the first and second task was significant  F 1  202    17.41  p   .001   eta 2   .079. Thus  Hypothesis 3 was rejected. Table 2 shows the means and standard deviations of performance on the first and second task with respect to the selected option and feedback condition.</content></resource></resourceList><clientID>1</clientID></parameters>
