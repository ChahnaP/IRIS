mackerel sharks  blue dynamites  bonitos  spriglios  palomas  mdash  are truly beautiful animals  They are well adapted and active pelagic  open water  sharks  Like their cousin  the   great white    they keep their body temperature warmer than the surrounding water using a high metabolic rate and efficient heat exchange system  They are legendary swimmers reaching sustained speeds of   35   kph  with bursts to over   80   kph  and have been known to travel over   2 092   km in little over a month  These sharks have rapid growth rates  twice as fast as some of the other   Lamnidae   species  Males mature at around   2   m while females mature at about   2 6   m with maximum lengths of   4   m and max weights of over   500   kg               From Shark Explorers      Facebook       sharkexplorers com        There are two types of makos  the most common and widely spread are the shortfin makos    Isurus oxyrinchus    and the less common and more specialized   longfin or big eye makos    Isurus paucus      Makos represent the largest  fastest most sophisticated species of pelagic shark on our planet       An ancient relative   Isurus hastilus   is nearly identical in terms of tooth structure and function  The ancient mako   hastilus   was probably   6   m long and nearly   2 800   kg  it was the Cretaceous grand mako that shared the seas with   kronosaurs      ichthyosaurs    and   plesiosaurs           The mako sharks are an easily recognizable shark exhibiting all the traits of a   Lamnid    they are an extremely robust and streamlined shark with well developed eyes  larger in the longfin  and an endothermic circulatory system  warm bloodedness  that is known to maintain elevated muscle temperatures of up to   0 6   deg C above the ambient water temperature  Makos are heavily built with the trademark strong   caudal keels   that are a common feature among Lamnids such as   great whites      porbeagles    and   salmon sharks         Longfin makos are apparently a more deep water tropics dwelling predator of which little is known  It wasn t even described as a separate species until 1966       Makos have striking coloring with deep purple to indigo dorsal  upper  surfaces  silvery sides  and white ventral  under  surfaces  The longfin mako has a shaded coloration around their mouth and the underside of their snout  unlike the shortfin mako which is snow white around their mouth  Only   blue sharks   can rival the makos for beautiful coloration       Mako sharks have five large gill slits  well developed eyes  slightly larger in the longfin  and pronounced knife like  non serrated teeth  An extremely fast and active shark  they were propelled to  big game fishing  fame by author Zane Gray who was taken by the animals menacing appearance and volatility during the early part of this century  Author Ernest Hemingway was also impressed by the mako and depicted them as the marlin marauding monster in his classic novel the   Old Man and the Sea         Author Richard Ellis also wrote an excellent short story about a deep sea contest between a mako and a   broadbill swordfish   in his popular work    The Book of Sharks         World Range  amp  Habitat         OBIS Distribution map      Mako sharks are found around the world in warm and temperate seas  in the Pacific from Oregon to Chile  and juvenile makos are common in southern California during the summer months  Some scientists believe that female mako sharks migrate into San Diego s waters to have their pups  From spring to autumn  pups and 1 2 year old sharks can be found off San Diego  several miles out at sea               By   Joe Romeiro   333 Productions   joeromeiro com        Feeding Behavior  Ecology     The makos of today feed on some of the worlds fastest and highly developed tunas and billfish and are therefore considered apex predators  Makos are also known to prey on   squid      dolphins      porpoises      blue sharks      bonito      sea turtles    and   mackerels         Life History    Shortfin mako development is ovoviviparous  Developing young are intra uteral  within the uterus  cannibals that consume lesser developed siblings  Which is known as   oophagy    Very little else is known about the reproduction of shortfin makos because females abort embryos during capture  Litters of over 8 10 pups are uncommon       Female shortfin makos usually become sexually mature at a length of   3   m  Developing embryos feed on unfertilized eggs in the uterus during the gestation period of 15 18 months  The 4 18 surviving young are born live in the late winter and early spring at a length of about   70   cm  It is believed that females may rest for 18 months after birth before the next batch of eggs are fertilized         Ovoviviparous    eggs are retained within the body of the female in a brood chamber where the embryo develops  receiving nourishment from a yolk sac  This is the method of reproduction for the  live bearing  fishes where pups hatch from egg capsules inside the mother s uterus and are born soon afterward  Also known as   aplacental viviparous         Conservation Status  amp  Comments         Latest Conservation Status of Shortfin Mako Sharks    nbsp       Check the Seafood Watch List for this species          Makos are prized gamefish  Although an oceanic species  the shortfin mako s power  aggressiveness  teeth and great speed  make it a danger to humans  Shortfin makos have been blamed for a number of both nonfatal and fatal attacks on humans  Divers who have encountered shortfin makos note that they swim in a figure eight pattern and approach with mouths open prior to an attack  Shortfin makos frequently damage boats and injure fishermen after being hooked  Most attacks occur when the shark is either provoked or caught on the end of a fishing line  The mako is fished commercially and for recreation  In some areas this shark has been wrongly blamed for the depletion of commercial fishing stocks i e   mackerel  tuna  etc       The world s affinity for shark fin soup and the flesh of the shortfin mako has lead to a decrease in population numbers  Worldwide  the shortfin mako is not only subject to overharvesting by direct hunting  they are also often by catch victims of the tuna and swordfish fishing industries  As a result  the   U S  National Marine Fisheries Service  NMFS    has included the shortfin mako on their list of  managed  pelagic sharks  The NMFS has reduced the number of commercial and recreational shortfin mako catches allowed per year by 50  in an attempt to counter act its declining numbers  However  the NMFS regulations apply only to the United State s Atlantic and Gulf waters  Also hastening their population decrease is their slow reproductive rate       The shortfin mako is listed as Vulnerable  A2abd 3bd 4abd  on the   IUCN Red List of Threatened Species           VULNERABLE  VU      A taxon is Vulnerable when the best available evidence indicates that it meets any of the criteria A to E for Vulnerable    see Section V     and it is therefore considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the wild               References  amp  Further Research      The Pelagic Shark Research Foundation        Florida Museum of Natural History        David Hall s Encounters in the Sea

Cousteau</content></resource><resource><id>2</id><content> nbsp Sharks           nbsp        Sharks have long held a special awe and fascination for humans  possibly something to do with their unmatched ability as predators and their position at the top of the ocean food chain  Just the thought of sharks still induces a primeval fear in many people  but of those fortunate enough to see live sharks in their own element  most cannot help but have a feeling of admiration for their beauty of movement and their supreme efficiency as predators  Sharks are one of the most physically perfect lifeforms on this planet          While sharks are found almost everywhere in the world  146 s oceans  they are most common in tropical waters at depths above 2000m  the Indo pacific region being particularly rich in shark species             What makes sharks and rays different to other   145 fish  146              There are two major   145 groups  146  of fishes  those with bony skeletons  which form the largest group   Osteichythes  and those with cartilaginous skeletons    Chondrichthyes     which make up only around 1  of living fishes  Sharks possess cartilaginous skeletons  and this is their main defining feature  shared also by the rays and the Chimaera family  All three groups fall within the class   Chondrichthyes     cartilaginous fish   with sharks and rays belonging to the subclass   Elasmobranches            Chondrichthyes have been around for nearly 400 million years largely unchanged  having early on become superbly adapted to their ecological role  All sharks are carnivorous  and almost all are predators  with highly developed sensory systems and a large area of the brain assigned to processing sensory information  While people tend to imagine all sharks as being active hunters of other animals  in fact they occupy a huge range of ecological niches  from the huge  planktivorous Basking and Whale sharks to the bottom dwelling Carpet sharks  and probably the ultimate pelagic predator  the Great White shark          Scientists currently recognise around 30 families and 370 species of sharks  plus 38 species of ghost or Chimaera sharks  Chimaeras  Holocephali  differ in several ways from the elasmobranchii  having a fixed upper jaw and fused plate like teeth for crushing molluscs  only one external gill slit  long whip like tails and being mostly deep water benthic feeders            Physical Adaptations of Sharks            Elasmobranches possess a number of unique features suiting them to their existence as apex predators  from their shape  to their sensory systems and impressive dentition  While individual species vary considerably in their physical appearance  there are many adaptations they have in common          Unlike bony fish that have a swim bladder to regulate buoyancy  sharks control their position in the water column by having a light cartilaginous skeleton and large oily liver  oil being lighter than water   Not having a swim bladder also allows a shark to make fast changes in depth without having to wait for gas pressure to equalize  a necessary adaptation for   145 pursuit predators  146  hunting in depths from the surface to hundreds of metres deep          Although sharks have a diverse range of body shapes  the   145 typical  146  shark that most people are familiar with has a very streamlined fusiform  torpedo shape  body  and a tailfin with a longer upper lobe  This long upper tail lobe necessarily provides a downward driving force to balance forward lift generated by the pectoral fins and the flat ventral surface of the snout                       The fusiform body plan of a Gray Reef shark  Gray Whaler          Most   145 typical  146  shark species cruise at around 2 5kmph  1 3mph   but are capable of short bursts up to 30kmph  18mph  when needed in the pursuit of prey  Dermal denticles    145 teeth  146  on the skin  channel the surrounding water to produce laminar flow  which lowers friction and makes a shark   145 hydrodynamically quiet  146   133 another adaptation that aids in approaching prey          An interesting adaptation of many predatory shark species is a nictitating lower eyelid  which slides across the eyeball allowing the shark to protect its most vulnerable organs at the time of attack          Mackerel sharks  family Laminidae  are especially adapted for a pelagic predatory existence having a   145 conico cylindrical body shape  caudal fins for added stability  and a   145 heat exchanger system  146  which allows them to maintain a body temp up to 10 C above ambient temperature  making muscle operation more efficient  The great white shark is a prime example of the Laminidae family  and can be found in almost all latitudes                   A silky Epaulette shark in Lawadi  PNG          In addition to the   145 typically  146  shaped shark species  there is a diverse range of body forms to be found among the shark family  from elongated sinuous species such as the Epaulette shark which hunt among nooks and crannies in coral reefs  to broad and laterally flattened Guitar sharks  adapted to life on the sea bottom  As well as body shape  tooth type varies considerably among elasmobranches  depending on their predominant prey and hunting technique             Teeth            Sharks have probably the most efficient dentition of the animal world and are one of the only creatures able to remove large pieces of tissue  up to 10kg or more  from their prey with a single bite  The teeth are arranged in rows   up to five rows in some species  which are continuously replaced as those in use are damaged or lost  This process of tooth replacement continues throughout the lifespan  allowing the teeth to get bigger as the shark gets bigger      The bite force of a shark is enormous  with a large individual able to exert around 18 tons per square inch               Teeth of the Mako  left  and Great White        drawing   Dave Abbott             Tooth shape in sharks vary according to their different functions and the prey type pursued  Mako  146 s and Sand tiger  146 s have fang like teeth for seizing and holding prey to be swallowed whole such as small fish  whereas Tiger  146 s and White sharks have large triangular teeth for cutting large fish  squid  and even mammals into   145 bite size  146  pieces             Sensory systems            At distances less than 15m  45ft  vision is an important sense for sharks and many have an adaptation which allows them to optimise all the available light in dimly illuminated water  A mirrored reflecting layer behind the retina known as the   tapetum lucidum   acts as a photomultiplier  or   145 light magnifier  146   At distances greater than 15m  smell and taste takes over in importance  and sharks can detect blood and food in the water at levels as low as 1 part per 10 billion parts of water  All fish  including sharks  have a lateral line that is sensitive to vibrations and subtle changes in water movement around them   an important means of locating potential prey  or predators   Sharks however have an additional adaptation known as the   ampullae of Lorenzini    a group of specialised sensory receptors  teleceptors  that can pick up the weak   145 bio electric  146  signals that is given off by all living organisms  To top off this formidable arsenal of   145 detection organs  146   sharks have an acute sense of hearing that is extremely sensitive to low frequency vibrations  as is made by a struggling fish  133 or something splashing on the surface             Hunting Strategies            As mentioned  sharks occupy a variety of ecological niches  and the different species pursue a diversity of prey  from minute plankton and small invertebrates right up to large marine mammals      Some of the smaller reef sharks such as the Epaulette shark have narrow flexible bodies and strong pectoral fins that allow them to hunt through small crevices in coral reefs in pursuit of   145 cryptic  146  prey  Such species occupy an ecological niche similar to the Moray eel                   A Whale shark encounter in Isla San Benedicto          Species such as the Swell shark and the Angel shark are   145 lie in wait  146  or ambush predators  relying on camouflage to hide them until their prey comes within striking distance  Basking sharks and other filter feeders like the Whale shark suck water in through their mouths as they swim and purge it through their gill slits  filtering out the food in each mouthful  occupying a similar niche to the baleen whales and the Manta ray          Others like the Thresher shark and Sawshark have adapted themselves to hunting schooling prey  flailing their elongated tail or tooth studded rostrum amongst a school of fish until sufficient are stunned or impaled  Generally larger sharks take larger prey  and feeding activity increases at certain times of the day  and at certain tidal phases  Most sharks are nocturnal  and flood tide is a favourite time to feed for many reef species                   A Scalloped Hammerhead shark          Mako sharks  Seven gill  146 s and Hammerheads can all be classed as pursuit predators  relying on speed and agility to catch their prey  whereas the infamous Great White is a stalking predator  usually attempting to approach its prey undetected until the final moment of attack          Most of the predatory shark species employ countershading  which is when the dorsal  upper  surface of the shark is a dark colour that seen from above blends with the blue of deep water  and the ventral  underside  is white to merge with the bright surface light apparent from below             Shark Behaviour            Interestingly  sharks have not yet been found to exhibit territoriality  that is  defence of a particular area  They do however defend a   145 personal field  146  or   145 space  146  and will first engage in a threat display  and then attack any creature entering this space    145 Might is right  146  in sharks and a smaller individual will always give way to a larger individual  although sex also plays a role  and females will often give way to males                   Schooling Hammerheads          Some species like the Scalloped Hammerhead and the pelagic Blue shark form large aggregations at times  whereas others like the Tiger shark and the Oceanic Whitetip are usually solitary  Many species travel vast distances making research into their behaviour very difficult  One Blue shark for example was recaptured 6000km from where it was first tagged          Although once thought to be   145 automatons  146   sharks are now recognised as having a level of intelligence not before realised  Even though   145 intelligence  146  is not an easy quality to measure in any animal  as it must be related to their level of existence rather than to a   145 human interpretation  146              Reproduction            Bony fish generally produce millions of small eggs in order to overcome the high mortality resulting from their vulnerability to predation  Sharks on the other hand lay fewer  but larger eggs that are fertilised internally  and so suffer a much lower mortality rate  To accomplish this internal fertilisation  the males have modified pelvic fins  or   145 claspers  146   with which they transfer sperm to the female  these organs are a good way to distinguish males sharks from females          During courtship and mating male sharks often bite the female  sometimes quite severely  and to combat this  in some species the female has much thicker skin than the male          The young of elasmobranches develop in one of three distinct ways depending on their species  The simplest  known as   Oviparity    is when eggs are laid in leathery case made of   145 keratin  146   In some cases the eggs are laid straight away  in other cases they are retained in the uteri until the embryos are nearly developed  generally between 2 and 15 months          The majority of shark species are   Ovoviviparous    that is the eggs are retained in the oviducts where they hatch and remain until the young are fully developed  There are different forms of nourishment according to the type of ovoviviparity  in   145   yolk sac viviparity    146   the young feed off a yolk sac attached to their digestive tract  while with   Uterine viviparity   the embryo relies on a rich secretion from the uterine lining for nourishment  In   Intra uterine cannibalism    the strongest embryos eat the weaker ones while they are still in the uterus  Gestation can vary between 6 and 22 months            Viviparity    when the young are nourished through a placenta  occurs in only 9  of chondrichthyes  Only the more advanced species  such as the Great White are viviparous and they have fewer but larger young which are born alive  Gestation in these species is approximately 8 12 months          In general  growth in sharks is relatively slow and their average lifespan is somewhere around 20 30 years  although some dogfish live as long as 70 years  Large pelagic species such as the Great White  Mako  and Blue whaler can grow approximately 30cm per year                   A small Whitetip Reef shark on the Great Barrier Reef           Sharks and Man            Although sharks have long been feared by man  it is common nowadays for divers to actively seek out encounters with almost all species of sharks and the almost non existence of problems resulting from these frequent encounters has changed many people s perception of sharks  Only a small percentage of the 370 species of shark have the potential to harm man and even less have been actually implicated in attacks  Usually when an attack does occur it is a case of mistaken identity  sharks certainly aren  146 t the   145 oceanic assassins  146  the media generally depicts them to be  Only around 6 people are killed each year by sharks  this despite the millions of people around the world that enter the water  On the other hand around 15   million   sharks are killed by humans each year  so while people tend to think of human shark interrelationships from the point of view of the danger sharks pose to man  in reality it is the other way around  133 humans are far more dangerous to sharks  We use their teeth for jewellery  liver oil for high grade lubricating oil  pharmaceuticals and vitamins  cartilage for health food supplements  flesh for food and fertilisers  and there is a large market in Asian countries for shark fins to be used as aphrodisiacs and in shark fin soup  US 100 kg             Threats and Management            Sharks are currently under threat from all sides  As well as target fishing  they also form a huge  by catch  in other fisheries  Additionally  there is a large recreational fishery and in many cases  those sharks caught are killed  weighed and   145 scored  146   and then wastefully dumped at sea  Coastal development is reducing shark   145 nursery areas  146   and environmental threats such as pollution  and bio amplification of organ compounds and heavy metals  directly or indirectly impact on sharks just as they do on all marine species          As sharks are generally slow growing  late maturing  and produce relatively few young  the fishery requires careful management  For example  species that live to 50 or more years can only sustain a harvest of around 2 3  of the population  and fishing beyond this limit results in a   145 population collapse  146           Even shark netting bathing beaches accounts for high numbers of sharks  many of which are harmless anyway  In Queensland Australia alone  over 20 000 sharks died in beach nets over 16 years   not to mention   468   dugongs  317 porpoises  10 889 rays  and 2 654 sea turtles           Sharks generally occupy the top position in the food chain and perform a necessary function within the marine ecosystem in regulating populations of other species  culling the weaker individuals and maintaining   145 genetic fitness  146  of fish populations  By reducing their numbers excessively we are tampering with the health of the ocean we so heavily depend upon          Unfortunately  because sharks are not   145 cute and cuddly  146  and many people are ignorant of the important role they play  they do not attract the same level of attention and protection that many   145 charismatic  146  terrestrial animals enjoy  This is a shame  as seen in their own environment sharks are incredibly beautiful  and more deserving of our admiration and respect  When you stop to consider the minute number of attacks as a percentage of the millions of people entering the water each year around the world  it seems ridiculous to do what seems to be our best to exterminate these incredible creatures          Many traditional cultures revered sharks  including the Haida Indians of the Pacific Northwest  the Polynesians and Melanesians  Even Aristotle in 380BC wrote of his impressions of shark biology and behaviour  It is to be hoped that with increasing environmental awareness in the new millennium sharks will once more regain the reverence and respect they formerly held             Dave Abbott

fin    The members of the order   Hexanchiformes   have only a single dorsal fin  The anal fin is absent in the orders Hexanchiformes    Squaliformes      Squatiniformes    and   Pristiophoriformes    Shark fins are supported by internal rays called ceratotrichia        Tail       edit          The tail of a shark consists of the   caudal peduncle   and the caudal fin  which provide the main source of thrust for the shark  Most sharks have   heterocercal   caudal fins  meaning that the backbone extends into the  usually longer  upper lobe  The shape of the caudal fin reflects the shark s lifestyle  and can be broadly divided into five categories         Fast swimming sharks of open waters  such as the   mackerel sharks    have crescent shaped tails with upper and lower lobes of almost equal size  The high aspect ratio of the tail serves to enhance swimming power and efficiency  In these species  there are usually also lateral keels on the caudal peduncle  The   whale shark   and   basking shark   also have this type of tail  although they are generally more sedate animals than the other examples             Typical sharks   such as   requiem sharks    have tails with the upper lobe longer than the lower  The upper lobe is turned upwards at a moderate angle relative to the body  which balances cruising efficiency with turning ability  The   thresher sharks   have an extreme example of this tail in which the upper lobe has evolved into a weapon for stunning prey              Bottom dwelling   sharks such as   catsharks   and   carpet sharks   have tails with long upper lobes and virtually no lower lobe  The upper lobe is held at a very low angle  which sacrifices speed for maneuverability  These sharks generally swim with eel like undulations              Dogfish sharks   also have tails with longer upper than lower lobes  However  the backbone runs through the upper lobe at a lower angle than the lobe itself  reducing the amount of downward thrust produced  Their tails cannot sustain high speeds  but combine the capability for bursts of speed with maneuverability              Angel sharks   have unique tails among sharks  Their caudal fins are reverse heterocercal  with the lower lobe larger than the upper          1                   Integument       edit          Main article    Dermal denticle       Unlike bony fish  the sharks have a complex dermal corset made of flexible collagenous fibres and arranged as a helical network surrounding their body  This works as an outer skeleton  providing attachment for their swimming muscles and thus saving energy  A similar arrangement of collagen fibres has been discovered in   dolphins   and   squid    Their dermal teeth give them hydrodynamic advantages as they reduce turbulence when swimming        Respiratory system       edit                                  The gill slits of a whale shark flaring as it expels water from its pharyngeal cavity            Like other fishes  sharks extract oxygen from water as it passes over their   gills    The water enters through the mouth  passes into the pharynx  and exits through the gill slits  most sharks have five pairs  the   frilled sharks      cow sharks    and   sixgill sawshark   have six or seven pairs   Almost all sharks also have an accessory respiratory opening called a   spiracle   behind their eyes  In bottom dwelling sharks such as   angel sharks    the spiracle allows them to take in water to breathe without having to open their mouths      There are two mechanisms that sharks can use to move water over their gills  in buccal pumping  the shark actively pulls in water using its buccal muscles  while in ram ventilation  water is passed automatically over the gills as the shark is swimming  As buccal pumping is more energy intensive than ram ventilation  the former is generally used by sedentary  bottom dwelling sharks while the latter is used by more active sharks  Most sharks can switch between these mechanisms as the situation requires  A few species  such as the   great white shark    have lost the ability to perform buccal pumping and thus will suffocate if they stop moving forward          2

characterized by a   cartilaginous     skeleton    five to seven   gill slits   on the sides of the head  and   pectoral fins   that are not fused to the head  Modern sharks are classified within the   clade     Selachimorpha    or   Selachii     and are the sister group to the   rays    However  the term  shark  has also been used for   extinct   members of the subclass   Elasmobranchii   outside the Selachimorpha  such as     Cladoselache     and     Xenacanthus      Under this broader definition  the earliest known sharks date from more than 420 million years ago          1              Since  sharks have diversified into   over 470 species    They range in size from the small   dwarf lanternshark      Etmopterus perryi     a   deep sea   species of only 17 centimetres  6 7  160 in  in length  to the   whale shark      Rhincodon typus     the largest fish in the world  which reaches approximately 12 metres  39  160 ft   Sharks are found in all seas and are common to depths of 2 000 metres  6 600  160 ft   They generally do not live in   freshwater   although there are a few known exceptions  such as the   bull shark   and the   river shark    which can survive in both seawater and freshwater          2          They breathe through five to seven   gill   slits  Sharks have a covering of   dermal denticles   that protects their skin from damage and   parasites   in addition to improving their   fluid dynamics    They have several sets of replaceable teeth          3              Well known species such as the   great white shark      tiger shark      blue shark

      The etymology of the word  shark  is uncertain  One theory is that it derives from the   Yucatec Maya   word   xok    pronounced  shok           6          Evidence for this etymology comes from the   OED    which notes the name  shark  first came into use after Sir   John Hawkins    sailors exhibited one in London in 1569 and used the word    sharke    to refer to the large sharks of the   Caribbean Sea        An alternate etymology states that the original sense of the word was that of  predator  one who preys on others  from the German   Schorck    a variant of   Schurke    villain  scoundrel   cf    card shark      loan shark    etc    which was later applied to the fish due to its predatory behaviour          7                Evolution                               A collection of   Cretaceous     shark teeth             See also    Evolution of fish       Evidence for the existence of sharks dates from the   Ordovician   period  over 450   420 million years ago  before land   vertebrates   existed and before many   plants   had colonized the continents          1          Only scales have been recovered from the first sharks and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true sharks          8          The oldest generally accepted shark scales are from about 420 million years ago  in the   Silurian   period          8          The first sharks looked very different from modern sharks          9          The majority of modern sharks can be traced back to around 100 million years ago          10          Most fossils are of   teeth    often in large numbers  Partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered  Estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime  which explains the abundant fossils  The teeth consist of easily fossilized   calcium phosphate    an   apatite    When a shark dies  the decomposing skeleton breaks up  scattering the apatite prisms  Preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments      Among the most ancient and primitive sharks is     Cladoselache      from about 370 million years ago          9          which has been found within   Paleozoic   strata in   Ohio      Kentucky   and   Tennessee    At that point in   Earth   s history these rocks made up the soft bottom sediments of a large  shallow ocean  which stretched across much of   North America      Cladoselache   was only about 1 metre  3 3  160 ft  long with stiff triangular fins and slender jaws          9          Its teeth had several pointed cusps  which wore down from use  From the small number of teeth found together  it is most likely that   Cladoselache   did not replace its teeth as regularly as modern sharks  Its caudal fins had a similar shape to the   great white sharks   and the pelagic   shortfin   and   longfin makos    The presence of whole fish arranged tail first in their stomachs suggest that they were fast swimmers with great agility      Most fossil sharks from about 300 to 150 million years ago can be assigned to one of two groups  The   Xenacanthida   was almost exclusive to freshwater environments          11                  12          By the time this group became extinct about 220 million years ago  they had spread worldwide  The other group  the   hybodonts    appeared about 320 million years ago and lived mostly in the oceans  but also in freshwater                                  Megalodon     with the whale shark  great white shark  and a human for scale           Modern sharks began to appear about 100 million years ago          10          Fossil   mackerel shark   teeth date to the   Early Cretaceous    One of the most recently evolved families is the hammerhead shark  family Sphyrnidae   which emerged in the   Eocene            13          The oldest white shark teeth date from 60 to 65 million years ago  around the time of the   extinction of the dinosaurs    In early white shark evolution there are at least two lineages  one lineage is of white sharks with coarsely   serrated   teeth and it probably gave rise to the modern great white shark  and another lineage is of white sharks with finely serrated teeth  These sharks attained gigantic proportions and include the extinct megatoothed shark      C  megalodon      Like most extinct sharks    C  megalodon   is also primarily known from its fossil teeth and vertebrae  This giant shark reached a total length  TL  of more than 16 metres  52  160 ft           14                  15            C  megalodon   may have approached a maxima of 20 3 metres  67  160 ft  in total length and 103   metric tons    114  160   short tons    in mass          16          Paleontological evidence suggests that this shark was an active predator of large   cetaceans            16                Taxonomy                  Sharks belong to the   superorder   Selachimorpha in the   subclass     Elasmobranchii   in the   class     Chondrichthyes    The Elasmobranchii also include   rays   and   skates    the Chondrichthyes also include   Chimaeras    It is currently thought that the sharks form a   polyphyletic   group  some sharks are more closely related to rays than they are to some other sharks          17              The superorder Selachimorpha is divided into Galea  or   Galeomorphii     and Squalea  The Galeans are the   Heterodontiformes      Orectolobiformes      Lamniformes    and   Carcharhiniformes    Lamnoids and Carcharhinoids are usually placed in one   clade    but recent studies show the Lamnoids and Orectoloboids are a clade  Some scientists now think that Heterodontoids may be Squalean  The Squalea is divided into Hexanchoidei and Squalomorpha  The Hexanchoidei includes the   Hexanchiformes   and   Chlamydoselachiformes    The Squalomorpha contains the   Squaliformes   and the Hypnosqualea  The Hypnosqualea may be invalid  It includes the   Squatiniformes    and the Pristorajea  which may also be invalid  but includes the   Pristiophoriformes   and the   Batoidea            17                  18              More than 440 species of sharks split across eight   orders    listed below in roughly their evolutionary relationship from ancient to modern          18                   Hexanchiformes    Examples from this group include the   cow sharks   and   frilled shark    which somewhat resembles a marine snake        Squaliformes    This group includes the   bramble sharks      dogfish   and   roughsharks    and   prickly shark          Pristiophoriformes    These are the   sawsharks    with an elongated  toothed snout that they use for slashing their prey        Squatiniformes    Also known as   angel sharks    they are flattened sharks with a strong resemblance to   stingrays   and   skates          Heterodontiformes    They are generally referred to as the   bullhead   or   horn sharks          Orectolobiformes    They are commonly referred to as the   carpet sharks    including   zebra sharks      nurse sharks      wobbegongs   and the   whale shark          Carcharhiniformes    Commonly known as   groundsharks    the species include the   blue      tiger      bull      grey reef      blacktip reef      Caribbean reef      blacktail reef      whitetip reef   and   oceanic whitetip sharks    collectively called the   requiem sharks    along with the   houndsharks      catsharks   and   hammerhead sharks    They are distinguished by an elongated snout and a   nictitating membrane   which protects the eyes during an attack        Lamniformes    They are commonly known as the   mackerel sharks    They include the   goblin shark      basking shark      megamouth shark    the   thresher sharks      shortfin   and   longfin mako sharks    and   great white shark    They are distinguished by their large jaws and   ovoviviparous   reproduction  The Lamniformes include the extinct   megalodon      Carcharodon megalodon             Anatomy                               General anatomical features of sharks           Main article    Shark anatomy         Teeth       Main article    Shark tooth                               The teeth of   tiger sharks   are oblique and serrated to saw through flesh           Shark teeth are embedded in the   gums   rather than directly affixed to the jaw  and are constantly replaced throughout life  Multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove on the inside of the jaw and steadily move forward in comparison to a   conveyor belt    some sharks lose 30 000 or more teeth in their lifetime  The rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months  In most species  teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row  which is observed in the   cookiecutter shark            19              Tooth shape depends on the shark s diet  those that feed on   mollusks   and   crustaceans   have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing  those that feed on fish have needle like teeth for gripping  and those that feed on larger prey such as   mammals   have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with   serrated   edges for cutting  The teeth of plankton feeders such as the   basking shark   are small and non functional          20                Skeleton       Shark skeletons are very different from those of   bony fish   and   terrestrial vertebrates    Sharks and other   cartilaginous fish      skates   and   rays    have skeletons made of   cartilage   and   connective tissue    Cartilage is flexible and durable  yet is about half the normal density of bone  This reduces the skeleton   s weight  saving energy          21          Because sharks do not have rib cages  they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land          22                Jaw         Jaws   of sharks  like those of rays and skates  are not attached to the   cranium    The jaw s surface  in comparison to the shark s   vertebrae   and gill arches  needs extra support due to its heavy exposure to physical stress and its need for strength  It has a layer of tiny   hexagonal   plates called    tesserae     which are   crystal   blocks of calcium salts arranged as a   mosaic            23          This gives these areas much of the same strength found in the bony tissue found in other animals      Generally sharks have only one layer of tesserae  but the jaws of large specimens  such as the   bull shark      tiger shark    and the   great white shark    have two to three layers or more  depending on body size  The jaws of a large   great white shark   may have up to five layers          21          In the   rostrum    snout   the cartilage can be spongy and flexible to absorb the power of impacts        Fins       Fin skeletons are elongated and supported with soft and unsegmented rays named ceratotrichia  filaments of elastic   protein   resembling the horny   keratin   in   hair   and   feathers            24          Most sharks have eight fins  Sharks can only drift away from objects directly in front of them because their fins do not allow them to move in the tail first direction          22                Dermal denticles       Main article    Dermal denticle       Unlike bony fish  sharks have a complex dermal   corset   made of flexible   collagenous     fibers   and arranged as a   helical   network surrounding their body  This works as an outer skeleton  providing attachment for their swimming muscles and thus saving energy          25          Their dermal teeth give them   hydrodynamic   advantages as they reduce   turbulence   when swimming          19                Tails         Tails   provide thrust  making speed and acceleration dependent on tail shape    Caudal fin   shapes vary considerably between shark species  due to their evolution in separate environments  Sharks possess a   heterocercal   caudal fin in which the   dorsal   portion is usually noticeably larger than the   ventral   portion  This is because the shark s   vertebral column   extends into that dorsal portion  providing a greater surface area for   muscle   attachment  This allows more efficient   locomotion   among these negatively   buoyant   cartilaginous fish  By contrast  most bony fish possess a   homocercal   caudal fin          26              Tiger sharks have a large upper   lobe    which allows for slow cruising and sudden bursts of speed  The tiger shark must be able to twist and turn in the water easily when hunting to support its varied diet  whereas the   porbeagle shark    which hunts schooling fish such as   mackerel   and   herring    has a large lower lobe to help it keep pace with its fast swimming prey          27          Other tail adaptations help sharks catch prey more directly  such as the   thresher shark   s usage of its powerful  elongated upper lobe to stun fish and squid        Physiology         Buoyancy       Unlike bony fish  sharks do not have gas filled swim bladders for buoyancy  Instead  sharks rely on a large liver filled with oil that contains   squalene    and their cartilage  which is about half the normal density of bone          25          Their liver constitutes up to 30  of their total body mass          28          The liver s effectiveness is limited  so sharks employ   dynamic lift   to maintain depth when not swimming    Sand tiger sharks   store air in their stomachs  using it as a form of swim bladder  Most sharks need to constantly swim in order to breathe and cannot sleep very long without sinking  if at all   However  certain species  like the   nurse shark    are capable of pumping water across their gills  allowing them to rest on the ocean bottom          29              Some sharks  if inverted or stroked on the   nose    enter a natural state of   tonic immobility    Researchers use this condition to handle sharks safely          30                Respiration       Like other fish  sharks extract   oxygen   from seawater as it passes over their   gills    Unlike other fish  shark gill slits are not covered  but lie in a row behind the head  A modified slit called a   spiracle   lies just behind the   eye    which assists the shark with taking in water during   respiration   and plays a major role in bottom   dwelling sharks  Spiracles are reduced or missing in active   pelagic   sharks          20          While the shark is moving  water passes through the mouth and over the gills in a process known as  ram ventilation   While at rest  most sharks pump water over their gills to ensure a constant supply of oxygenated water  A small number of species have lost the ability to pump water through their gills and must swim without rest  These species are   obligate ram ventilators   and would presumably   asphyxiate   if unable to move  Obligate ram ventilation is also true of some pelagic bony fish species          31              The respiration and   circulation   process begins when deoxygenated   blood   travels to the shark s two chambered   heart    Here the shark pumps blood to its gills via the ventral   aorta     artery   where it branches into   afferent     brachial   arteries  Reoxygenation takes place in the gills and the reoxygenated blood flows into the   efferent   brachial arteries  which come together to form the   dorsal aorta    The blood flows from the dorsal aorta throughout the body  The deoxygenated blood from the body then flows through the posterior   cardinal veins   and enters the posterior cardinal   sinuses    From there blood enters the heart   ventricle   and the cycle repeats          32                Thermoregulation       Most sharks are  cold blooded  or  more precisely    poikilothermic    meaning that their internal   body temperature   matches that of their ambient environment  Members of the family   Lamnidae    such as the   shortfin mako shark   and the   great white shark    are   homeothermic   and maintain a higher body temperature than the surrounding water  In these sharks  a strip of   aerobic   red muscle located near the center of the body generates the heat  which the body retains via a   countercurrent exchange   mechanism by a system of   blood vessels   called the   rete mirabile     miraculous net    The   common thresher shark   has a similar mechanism for maintaining an elevated body temperature  which is thought to have evolved independently         not in citation given                   33                Osmoregulation       In contrast to bony fish  with the exception of the   coelacanth            34          the blood and other tissue of sharks and   Chondrichthyes   is generally   isotonic   to their marine environments because of the high concentration of   urea   and   trimethylamine   N oxide  TMAO   allowing them to be in   osmotic   balance with the seawater  This adaptation prevents most sharks from surviving in freshwater  and they are therefore confined to   marine   environments  A few exceptions exist  such as the   bull shark    which has developed a way to change its   kidney   function to excrete large amounts of urea          28          When a shark dies  the urea is broken down to ammonia by bacteria  causing the dead body to gradually smell strongly of ammonia          35                  36                Digestion       Digestion can take a long time  The food moves from the mouth to a J shaped stomach  where it is stored and initial digestion occurs          37          Unwanted items may never get past the stomach  and instead the shark either vomits or turns its stomachs inside out and ejects unwanted items from its mouth      One of the biggest differences between the digestive systems of sharks and mammals is that sharks have much shorter intestines  This short length is achieved by the   spiral valve   with multiple turns within a single short section instead of a long tube like intestine  The valve provides a long surface area  requiring food to circulate inside the short gut until fully digested  when remaining waste products pass into the   cloaca            37                Senses         Smell                               The shape of the   hammerhead shark   s head may enhance olfaction by spacing the nostrils further apart            Sharks have keen   olfactory   senses  located in the short duct  which is not fused  unlike bony fish  between the anterior and posterior nasal openings  with some species able to detect as little as one   part per million   of blood in seawater          38              Sharks have the ability to determine the direction of a given scent based on the timing of scent detection in each nostril          39          This is similar to the method mammals use to determine direction of sound      They are more attracted to the chemicals found in the intestines of many species  and as a result often linger near or in   sewage   outfalls  Some species  such as   nurse sharks    have external   barbels   that greatly increase their ability to sense prey        Sight                               Eye of a   Bigeyed sixgill shark      Hexanchus nakamurai              Shark   eyes   are similar to the eyes of other   vertebrates    including similar   lenses      corneas   and   retinas    though their eyesight is well adapted to the   marine   environment with the help of a tissue called   tapetum lucidum    This tissue is behind the   retina   and reflects light back to it  thereby increasing visibility in the dark waters  The effectiveness of the tissue varies  with some sharks having stronger   nocturnal   adaptations  Many sharks can contract and dilate their   pupils    like humans  something no   teleost fish   can do  Sharks have eyelids  but they do not blink because the surrounding water cleans their eyes  To protect their eyes some species have   nictitating membranes    This membrane covers the eyes while hunting and when the shark is being attacked  However  some species  including the   great white shark      Carcharodon carcharias     do not have this membrane  but instead roll their eyes backwards to protect them when striking prey  The importance of sight in shark hunting behavior is debated  Some believe that   electro    and   chemoreception   are more significant  while others point to the nictating membrane as evidence that sight is important  Presumably  the shark would not protect its eyes were they unimportant  The use of sight probably varies with species and water conditions  The shark s field of vision can swap between   monocular   and   stereoscopic   at any time          40          A   micro spectrophotometry   study of 17 species of shark found 10 had only   rod photoreceptors   and no cone cells in their   retinas   giving them good night vision while making them   colorblind    The remaining seven species had in addition to rods a single type of   cone photoreceptor   sensitive to green and  seeing only in shades of grey and green  are believed to be effectively colorblind  The study indicates that an object s contrast against the background  rather than colour  may be more important for object detection          41                   42                  43                Hearing       Although it is hard to test sharks  hearing  they may have a sharp   sense of hearing   and can possibly hear prey many miles away          44          A small opening on each side of their heads  not the   spiracle    leads directly into the   inner ear   through a thin channel  The   lateral line   shows a similar arrangement  and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line   pores    This is a reminder of the common origin of these two vibration  and sound detecting organs that are grouped together as the acoustico lateralis system  In bony fish and   tetrapods   the external opening into the inner ear has been lost        Electroreception       Main article    Electroreception                               Electromagnetic field receptors  ampullae of Lorenzini  and motion detecting canals in the head of a shark           The   ampullae of Lorenzini   are the electroreceptor organs  They number in the hundreds to thousands  Sharks use the ampullae of Lorenzini to detect the   electromagnetic fields   that all living things produce          45          This helps sharks  particularly the   hammerhead shark    find prey  The shark has the greatest electrical sensitivity of any animal  Sharks find prey hidden in sand by detecting the   electric fields   they produce    Ocean currents   moving in the   magnetic field of the Earth   also generate electric fields that sharks can use for orientation and possibly navigation          46                Lateral line       Main article    Lateral line       This system is found in most fish  including sharks  It detects motion or vibrations in water  The shark can sense frequencies in the range of 25 to 50  160   Hz            47                Life history                               The claspers of male   spotted wobbegong             Shark lifespans vary by species  Most live 20 to 30 years  The   spiny dogfish   has the longest lifespan at more than 100 years          48            Whale sharks      Rhincodon typus    may also live over 100 years          49                Reproduction       Unlike most   bony fish    sharks are   K selected   reproducers  meaning that they produce a small number of well developed young as opposed to a large number of poorly developed young    Fecundity   in sharks ranges from 2 to over 100 young per reproductive cycle          50          Sharks mature slowly relative to many other fish  For example    lemon sharks   reach sexual maturity at around age 13   15          51                Sexual       Sharks practice   internal fertilization    The posterior part of a male shark s pelvic fins are modified into a pair of   intromittent organs   called   claspers    analogous to a mammalian   penis    of which one is used to deliver   sperm   into the female          52                Mating   has rarely been observed in sharks  The smaller   catsharks   often mate with the male curling around the female  In less flexible species the two sharks swim parallel to each other while the male inserts a clasper into the female s   oviduct    Females in many of the larger species have bite marks that appear to be a result of a male grasping them to maintain position during   mating    The bite marks may also come from courtship behavior  the male may bite the female to show his interest  In some species  females have evolved thicker skin to withstand these bites          52                Asexual       There are two documented cases in which a female shark who has not been in contact with a male has conceived a pup on her own through   parthenogenesis            53                  54          The details of this process are not well understood  but   genetic fingerprinting   showed that the pups had no paternal genetic contribution  ruling out   sperm storage    The extent of this behavior in the wild is unknown  as is whether other species have this capability  Mammals are now the only major   vertebrate   group in which   asexual reproduction   has not been observed      Scientists assert that asexual reproduction in the wild is rare  and probably a last ditch effort to reproduce when a mate is not present  Asexual reproduction diminishes   genetic diversity    which helps build defenses against threats to the species  Species that rely solely on it risk extinction  Asexual reproduction may have contributed to the   blue shark   s decline off the   Irish   coast          55                Brooding       Sharks display three ways to bear their young  varying by species    oviparity      viviparity   and   ovoviviparity            56                Ovoviviparity       Most sharks are   ovoviviparous    meaning that the eggs hatch in the   oviduct   within the mother s body and that the egg s   yolk   and fluids secreted by glands in the walls of the oviduct nourishes the embryos  The young continue to be nourished by the remnants of the yolk and the oviduct s fluids  As in viviparity  the young are born alive and fully functional    Lamniforme   sharks practice     oophagy      where the first embryos to hatch eat the remaining eggs  Taking this a step further    sand tiger shark   pups cannibalistically consume neighboring embryos  The survival strategy for ovoviviparous species is to   brood   the young to a comparatively large size before birth  The   whale shark   is now classified as ovoviviparous rather than oviparous  because extrauterine eggs are now thought to have been aborted  Most ovoviviparous sharks give birth in sheltered areas  including bays  river mouths and shallow reefs  They choose such areas for protection from predators  mainly other sharks  and the abundance of food    Dogfish   have the longest known   gestation period   of any shark  at 18 to 24 months    Basking sharks   and   frilled sharks   appear to have even longer gestation periods  but accurate data are lacking          56                Oviparity                               The spiral   egg case   of a   Port Jackson shark             Some species are   oviparous   like most other fish  laying their eggs in the water  In most oviparous shark species  an   egg case   with the consistency of   leather   protects the developing embryo s   These cases may be corkscrewed into crevices for protection  Once empty  the egg case is known as a     mermaid s purse      and can wash up on shore  Oviparous sharks include the   horn shark      catshark      Port Jackson shark    and   swellshark            56                  57                Viviparity       Finally some sharks maintain a     placental     link to the developing young  this method is called viviparity  This is more analogous to mammalian gestation than that of other fishes  The young are born alive and fully functional  Hammerheads  the   requiem sharks    such as the   bull   and   blue sharks     and   smoothhounds   are viviparous          50                  56                Behavior       The classic view describes a solitary hunter  ranging the oceans in search of food  However  this applies to only a few species  Most live far more sedentary    benthic   lives  Even solitary sharks meet for breeding or at rich hunting grounds  which may lead them to cover thousands of miles in a year          58          Shark migration patterns may be even more complex than in birds  with many sharks covering entire   ocean basins        Sharks can be highly social  remaining in large schools  Sometimes more than 100   scalloped hammerheads   congregate around   seamounts   and islands  e g   in the   Gulf of California            28          Cross species social hierarchies exist  For example    oceanic whitetip sharks   dominate   silky sharks   of comparable size during feeding          50              When approached too closely some sharks perform a   threat display    This usually consists of exaggerated swimming movements  and can vary in intensity according to the threat level          59                Speed       In general  sharks swim   cruise   at an average speed of 8 kilometres per hour  5 0  160 mph  but when feeding or attacking  the average shark can reach speeds upwards of 19 kilometres per hour  12  160 mph   The   shortfin mako shark    the fastest shark and one of the fastest fish  can burst at speeds up to 50 kilometres per hour  31  160 mph           60          The   great white shark   is also capable of speed bursts  These exceptions may be due to the   warm blooded    or   homeothermic    nature of these sharks  physiology        Intelligence       Sharks possess brain to body mass ratios that are similar to mammals and birds          61          and have exhibited apparent curiosity and behavior resembling play in the wild          62                  63                Sleep       All sharks need to keep water flowing over their gills in order for them to breathe  however not all species need to be moving to do this  Those that are able to breathe whilst not swimming breathe by using their   spiracles   to force water over their gills  thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from the water  It has been recorded that their eyes remain open whilst in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them         64          and as such they are not truly asleep      Species that do need to swim continuously to breathe go through a process known as sleep swimming  in which the shark is essentially unconscious  It is known from experiments conducted on the   spiny dogfish   that its   spinal cord    rather than its brain  coordinates swimming  so   spiny dogfish   can continue to swim while sleeping  and this also may be the case in larger shark species          64                  Ecology         Feeding       This section is about shark feeding   For the sport of shark feeding  see   Shark baiting        Most sharks are   carnivorous            65            Basking sharks      whale sharks    and   megamouth sharks   have independently evolved different strategies for filter feeding   plankton    basking sharks practice   ram feeding    whale sharks use suction to take in plankton and small fishes  and megamouth sharks make   suction feeding   more efficient by using the   luminescent   tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean  This type of feeding requires   gill rakers     long  slender filaments that form a very efficient   sieve     analogous to the   baleen   plates of the   great whales    The shark traps the plankton in these filaments and swallows from time to time in huge mouthfuls  Teeth in these species are comparatively small because they are not needed for feeding          65                                      Like many sharks  the great white shark is an   apex predator   in its environment            Other highly specialized feeders include   cookiecutter sharks    which feed on flesh sliced out of other larger fish and   marine mammals    Cookiecutter teeth are enormous compared to the animal s size  The lower teeth are particularly sharp  Although they have never been observed feeding  they are believed to latch onto their prey and use their thick lips to make a seal  twisting their bodies to rip off flesh          28              Some seabed   dwelling species are highly effective ambush predators    Angel sharks   and   wobbegongs   use camouflage to lie in wait and suck prey into their mouths          66          Many   benthic   sharks feed solely on   crustaceans   which they crush with their flat   molariform   teeth      Other sharks feed on   squid   or fish  which they swallow whole  The   viper dogfish   has teeth it can point outwards to strike and capture prey that it then swallows intact  The   great white   and other large predators either swallow small prey whole or take huge bites out of large animals    Thresher sharks   use their long tails to stun shoaling fishes  and   sawsharks   either stir prey from the seabed or slash at swimming prey with their tooth studded   rostra        Many sharks  including the   whitetip reef shark   are cooperative feeders and hunt in packs to herd and capture elusive prey  These social sharks are often migratory  traveling huge distances around   ocean basins   in large schools  These migrations may be partly necessary to find new food sources          67                Range and habitat       Sharks are found in all seas  They generally do not live in fresh water  with a few exceptions such as the   bull shark   and the   river shark   which can swim both in seawater and freshwater          68          Sharks are common down to depths of 2 000 metres  7 000  160 ft   and some live even deeper  but they are almost entirely absent below 3 000 metres  10 000  160 ft   The deepest confirmed report of a shark is a   Portuguese dogfish   at 3 700 metres  12 100  160 ft           69                Relationship with humans         Attacks

 International Shark Attack File    ISAF  undertook an investigation into 96 alleged shark attacks  confirming 62 of them as unprovoked attacks and 16 as provoked attacks  The average number of fatalities worldwide per year between 2001 and 2006 from unprovoked shark attacks is 4 3          70              Contrary to popular belief  only a few sharks are dangerous to humans  Out of more than 360 species  only four have been involved in a significant number of fatal  unprovoked attacks on humans  the   great white      oceanic whitetip      tiger    and   bull sharks            71                   72          These sharks are large  powerful predators  and may sometimes attack and kill people  Despite being responsible for attacks on humans they have all been filmed without using a protective cage          73              The perception of sharks as dangerous animals has been popularized by publicity given to a few isolated unprovoked attacks  such as the   Jersey Shore shark attacks of 1916    and through popular fictional works about shark attacks  such as the     Jaws     film series    Jaws   author   Peter Benchley    as well as     Jaws     director   Steven Spielberg   later attempted to dispel the image of sharks as man eating monsters          74                In captivity       Main article    Sharks in captivity       Until recently only a few   benthic   species of shark  such as   hornsharks      leopard sharks   and   catsharks   had survived in aquarium conditions for a year or more  This gave rise to the belief that sharks  as well as being difficult to capture and transport  were difficult to care for  More knowledge has led to more species  including the large   pelagic   sharks  living far longer in captivity  At the same time  safer transportation techniques have enabled long distance movement          75          One shark that never had been successfully held in captivity for long was the great white  But in September 2004 the   Monterey Bay Aquarium   successfully kept a young female for 198 days before releasing her                              A   whale shark   in   Georgia Aquarium             Most species are not suitable for home aquaria and not every species sold by   pet stores   are appropriate  Some species can flourish in home saltwater aquaria          76          Uninformed or unscrupulous dealers sometimes sell juvenile sharks like the   nurse shark    which upon reaching adulthood is far too large for typical home aquaria          76          Public aquaria generally do not accept donated specimens that have outgrown their housing  Some owners have been tempted to   release   them          76          Species appropriate to home aquaria represent considerable spatial and financial investments as they generally approach adult lengths of 3 feet and can live up to 25 years          76                In Hawaii       Sharks figure prominently in   Hawaiian mythology    Stories tell of men with shark jaws on their back who could change between shark and human form  A common theme was that a shark man would warn beach goers of sharks in the waters  The beach goers would laugh and ignore the warnings and get eaten by the shark man who warned them    Hawaiian   mythology also includes many shark   gods    Among a fishing people  the most popular of all   aumakua    or deified ancestor guardians  are shark aumakua    Kamaku   describes in detail how to offer a corpse to become a shark  The body transforms gradually until the   kahuna   can point the awe struck family to the markings on the shark s body that correspond to the clothing in which the beloved s body had been wrapped  Such a shark aumakua becomes the family pet  receiving food  and driving fish into the family net and warding off danger  Like all aumakua it had evil uses such as helping kill enemies  The ruling chiefs typically forbade such sorcery  Many Native Hawaiian families claim such an aumakua  who is known by name to the whole community          77                Kamohoali i   is the best known and revered of the shark gods  he was the older and favored brother of   Pele            78          and helped and journeyed with her to Hawaii  He was able to assume all human and fish forms  A summit cliff on the crater of   Kilauea   is one of his most sacred spots  At one point he had a     heiau      temple or shrine  dedicated to him on every piece of land that jutted into the ocean on the island of   Molokai    Kamohoali i was an ancestral god  not a human who became a shark and banned the eating of humans after eating one herself          79                  80          In Fijian mytholog    Dakuwanga   was a shark god who was the eater of lost souls        Popular misconceptions       A popular myth is that sharks are immune to disease and   cancer    this is not scientifically supported  Sharks may get cancer          81                  82          Both diseases and   parasites   affect sharks  The evidence that sharks are at least resistant to cancer and disease is mostly   anecdotal   and there have been few  if any  scientific or   statistical   studies that show sharks to have heightened immunity to disease          83          Other apparently false claims are that fins prevent   cancer           84          and treat   osteoarthritis            85          No scientific proof supports these claims  at least one study has shown shark cartilage of no value in cancer treatment          86                Conservation       Further information    Threatened sharks   and   Shark sanctuary                               The value of shark fins for   shark fin soup   has led to an increase in shark catches  Usually only the fins are taken  while the rest of the shark is discarded  usually into the sea                                    The annual shark catch has increased rapidly over the last 50 years

for 2010  Based on an analysis of average shark weights  this translates into a total annual mortality estimate of about 100 million sharks in 2000  and about 97 million sharks in 2010  with a total range of possible values between 63 and 273 million sharks per year          89          Sharks are a common seafood in many places  including   Japan   and   Australia    In the Australian state of

  Main article    Sharks in popular culture       Sharks are used in popular culture commonly as eating machines  notably in the     Jaws     novel and the   film of the same name    along with its   sequels    Sharks are threats in other films such as     Deep Blue Sea          The Reef      and   others    although they are sometimes used for comedic effect such as in     Finding Nemo     and the     Austin Powers     series  These comedic effects can sometimes be unintentional  as seen in     Batman  The Movie     and various   Syfy   channel films like     Dinoshark     and     Sharktopus          Sharks tend to be seen quite often in cartoons whenever a scene involves the ocean  Such examples include the     Tom and Jerry     cartoons      Jabberjaw      and other shows produced or created by     Hanna Barbera      They also are used commonly as a clich  d means of killing off a character that is held up by a rope or some similar object as the sharks swim right below them  or the character may be standing on a   plank   above shark infested waters        See also               Cartilaginous versus bony fishes         CMS Migratory Sharks Memorandum of

 There are more than 400 nbsp shark species in the ocean  but they all have the same basic anatomy         This amazing anatomy masterfully designed by evolution is what sets nbsp sharks apart from other types of aquatic  life including whales and dolphins         Understanding the basic description of shark anatomy will help you nbsp to understand the incredible  evolutive nbsp adaptations that have made sharks nbsp flawless predators         There are six important anatomic structures characteristic of sharks that will be described below in greater  detail

cartilage for their skeleton rather than bones  This is very different from humans and most  types of land animals  Having this cartilage though is what allows them to move at unbelievable speeds through the  water                                                                          All sharks have cartilage for their skeleton rather than                       bones                                                                   Dermal Denticles            Since sharks don rsquo t have bones they rely on dermal denticles on their skin nbsp to help them keep the right  shape  nbsp         Shark skin is very rough because if you see it very closely it is covered with small denticles         Denticles nbsp are found all over the body of every species of shark out there  They help make it easier to  swim nbsp and help nbsp the shark nbsp to save energy  They also help to protect the shark skin nbsp from various  elements in the water                     Jaw  amp  Teeth            Sharks don rsquo t have a jaw that is attached to their skull  Instead it moves as separate piece  The upper and the  lower jaw can work on their own without the other moving  This allows the shark to have a very powerful pull and to  be able to latch onto what it wants fiercely         Sharks have many rows of teeth and its shape depends on the shark s diet             Shark teeth nbsp are extremely sharp as most sharks are meat eaters  They can rip through meat and bones instantly  without any struggle at all  Sharks loose their teeth all the time and one from the rows behind it will move into  that position so they are always geared with a full army of them to attack  They can lose their front rows of teeth  every couple of weeks to a month  It is estimated a shark will go through 30 000 teeth in its lifetime                 Liver            Just like humans and many other types of animals sharks have a liver  They use theirs differently though  They  are able to store oils in it for a very long time  The more oil they store the less often they have to eat         Sharks are able to thrive on the oil that has been reserved in their livers for weeks  months  or even a year  before they have to feed again  Once the level of oil in the liver gets low though the hunt is on  A shark never  wants to deplete what is stored in the liver                 Tail            Each species of shark has a unique tail design  This has to do with the overall size of the shark as well as  what the purpose of the tail is  In many instances the tail allows the shark to move very fast in the water  Other  times it is to help balance the movements of the shark so that they can glide along gracefully         Tails give them the ability to make flexible movements  so make the best use of their cartilage skeleton           See the tail chart                         Fins            All species of sharks have fins as well  They have two sets of them that are matching pairs  They help them to move  along in the water as well as to pick up vibrations that are taking place  There is a dorsal fin on the back   sometimes two of them depending on the species  that helps with balancing  The anal fin on the underside of the  shark serves the same purpose         It is often said that the anatomy of an airplane is very similar to that of a shark  When you visualize this in  your mind you can see it is very true  There is a tail and the wings to help balance everything and to give it  speed  While there is no proof that the dynamic design of an airplane was developed from the shark it does make  sense  After all they have been able to thrive with that body design for millions of years  nbsp                     Highly Developed Senses            The highly developed

links                       Swimming       edit            Fish   swim by exerting force against the surrounding water  There are exceptions  but this is normally achieved by the fish contracting   muscles   on either side of its body in order to generate waves of   flexion   that travel the length of the body from nose to tail  generally getting larger as they go along  The   vector     forces   exerted on the water by such motion cancel out laterally  but generate a net force backwards which in turn pushes the fish forward through the water      Most fishes generate thrust using lateral movements of their body  amp    caudal fin    But there are also a huge number of species that move mainly using their median and paired fins  The latter group profits from the gained manoeuvrability that is needed when living in coral reefs for example  But they can t swim as fast as fish using their bodies  amp  caudal fins        Body caudal fin propulsion       edit          There are five groups that differ in the fraction of their body that is displaced laterally          1                Anguilliform locomotion       edit          In some long  slender fish       eels    for example     there is little increase in the amplitude of the flexion wave as it passes along the body        Sub carangiform locomotion       edit          Here  there is a more marked increase in wave amplitude along the body with the vast majority of the work being done by the rear half of the fish  In general  the fish body is stiffer  making for higher speed but reduced maneuverability    Trout   use sub carangiform locomotion        Carangiform locomotion       edit          Fish in this group are stiffer and faster moving than the previous groups  The vast majority of movement is concentrated in the very rear of the body and tail  Carangiform swimmers generally have rapidly oscillating tails        Thunniform locomotion       edit          The next to last group is reserved for the high speed long distance swimmers  like   tuna    new research shows that the thunniform locomotion is an   autapomorphy   of the tunas         2            Here  virtually all the lateral movement is in the tail and the region connecting the main body to the tail  the peduncle   The tail itself tends to be large and crescent shaped        Ostraciiform locomotion       edit          These fishes have no appreciable body wave when they employ caudal locomotion  Only the fin itself oscillates  often very rapidly  to create   thrust    This group includes   Ostraciidae          Median paired fin propulsion       edit          Not all fish fit comfortably in the above groups    Ocean sunfish    for example  have a completely different system  and many small fish use their   pectoral fins   for swimming as well as for steering and   dynamic lift    Fish with electric organs  such as those in   Gymnotiformes    swim by undulating their fins while keeping the body still  presumably so as not to disturb the electric field that they generate        Dynamic lift       edit                     Bone and muscle tissues of fish are denser than water  To maintain depth some fish increase   buoyancy   by means of a   gas bladder   or by storing oils or   lipids    Fish without these features use   dynamic lift   instead  It is done using their pectoral fins in a manner similar to the use of wings by   aeroplanes   and   birds    As these fish swim  their pectoral fins are positioned to create   lift   which allows the fish to maintain a certain depth        Sharks   are a notable example of fish that depend on dynamic lift  notice their well developed pectoral fins      The two major drawbacks of this method are that these fish must stay moving to stay afloat and that they are incapable of swimming backwards or hovering        Hydrodynamic principles       edit          Similarly to the aerodynamics of flight  powered swimming requires animals to overcome drag by producing thrust  Unlike flying  however  swimming animals do not necessarily need to actively exert high vertical forces because the effect of   buoyancy   can counter the downward pull of gravity  allowing these animals to float without much effort  While there is great diversity in fish locomotion  swimming behavior can be classified into two distinct  modes  based on the body structures involved in thrust production  Median Paired Fin  MPF  and Body Caudal Fin  BCF   Within each of these classifications  there are a numerous specifications along a spectrum of behaviors from purely   undulatory   to entirely   oscillatory   based  In undulatory swimming modes thrust is produced by wave like movements of the propulsive structure  usually a fin or the whole body   Oscillatory modes  on the other hand  are characterized by thrust production from swiveling of the propulsive structure on an attachment point without any wave like motion          3                                        Boxfish   are the classic biological example of MPF swimming because they are not well streamlined and use primarily their   pectoral fins   for thrust production              Median paired fin       edit          Many fish swim using combined behavior of their two   pectoral fins   or both their   anal   and   dorsal   fins  Different types of   Median Paired Fin  MPF    gait can be achieved by preferentially using one fin pair over the other  and include          3              UNDULATORY            Rajiform      seen in   rays      skates    and   mantas   when thrust is produced by vertical undulations along large  well developed pectoral fins        Diodontiform    in which propulsion is achieved by propagating undulations along large pectoral fins         Amiiform      undulations of a long dorsal fin while the body axis is held straight and stable         Gymnotiform      undulations of a long anal fin  essentially upside down amiiform         Balistiform      both anal and dorsal fins undulate        OSCILLATORY            Tetradontiform     dorsal and anal fins are flapped as a unit  either in phase or exactly opposing one another  The   ocean sunfish   is an extreme example of this form of locomotion        Labriform    oscillatory movements of pectoral fins and can be classified as drag based or lift based in which propulsion is generated either as a reaction to drag produced by dragging the fins through the water in a rowing motion or via lift mechanisms                       160                        Sardines   use body caudal fin propulsion to swim and hold their pectoral  dorsal  and anal fins flat against the body  creating a more   streamlined   body and reducing drag              Body caudal fin       edit          Most fish swim by generating undulatory waves that propagate down the body through the   caudal fin    This form of   undulatory locomotion   is termed   Body Caudal Fin  BCF    swimming on the basis of the body structures used          3                  4              UNDULATORY            Anguilliform      seen in   eels   and   lampreys    this locomotion mode is marked by whole body in large   amplitude     wavelengths    Both forward and backward swimming is possible in this type of BCF swimming          Subcarangiform     similar to anguilliform swimming  but with limited amplitude   anteriorly   that increases as the wave propagates   posteriorly    this locomotion mode is often seen in   trout            Carangiform      body undulations are restricted to the posterior third of body length with thrust produced by a stiff caudal fin         Thunniform      the most efficient aquatic locomotion mode with thrust being generated by lift during the lateral movements occurring in the caudal fin only  this locomotion mode has evolved under independent circumstances in   teleost  ray finned  fish      sharks    and   marine mammals           OSCILLATORY            Ostraciiform      the body remains rigid and the stiff caudal fin is swept in a   pendulum   like oscillation  Fish using this type of BCF locomotion  usually rely predominantly on MPF swimming modes  with ostraciiform behavior only an auxiliary behavior           Adaptation       edit          Similar to adaptation in avian flight  swimming behaviors in fish can be thought of as a balance of stability and maneuverability          5          Because BCF swimming relies on more   caudal   body structures that can direct powerful thrust only rearwards  this form of locomotion is particularly effective for accelerating quickly and cruising continuously          3                  4          BCF swimming is  therefore  inherently stable and is often seen in fish with large migration patterns that must maximize efficiency over long periods  Propulsive forces in MPF swimming  on the other hand  are generated by multiple fins located on either side of the body that can be coordinated to execute elaborate turns  As a result  MPF swimming is well adapted for high maneuverability and is often seen in smaller fish that require elaborate escape patterns          5              It is important to point out that fish do not rely exclusively on one locomotor mode  but are rather lomotor  generalists           3          choosing among and combining behaviors from many available behavioral techniques  In fact  at slower speeds  predominantly BCF swimmers will often incorporate movement of their   pectoral  anal  and dorsal fins   as an additional stabilizing mechanism at slower speeds  but hold them close to their body at high speeds to improve   streamlining   and reducing drag          3            Zebrafish   have even been observed to alter their locomotor behavior in response to changing hydrodynamic influences throughout growth and maturation          6              In addition to adapting locomotor behavior  controlling buoyancy effects is critical for aquatic survival since   aquatic ecosystems   vary greatly by depth  Fish generally control their depth by regulating the amount of gas in specialized organs that are much like balloons  By changing the amount of gas in these   swim bladders    fish actively control their density  If they increase the amount of air in their swim bladder  their overall density will become less than the surrounding water  and increased upward buoyancy pressures will cause the fish to rise until they reach a depth at which they are again at equilibrium with the surrounding water  In this way  fish behave essentially as a   hot air balloon   does in air        Flying       edit          See also    flying fish    160 and   flying and gliding animals       The transition of predominantly swimming locomotion directly to flight has evolved in a single family of marine fish called   Exocoetidae    Flying fish are not true fliers in the sense that they do not execute powered flight  Instead  these species glide directly over the surface of the ocean water without ever flapping their  wings   Flying fish have evolved abnormally large pectoral fins that act as airfoils and provide lift when the fish launches itself out of the water  Additional forward thrust and steering forces are created by dipping the hypocaudal  i e  bottom  lobe of their caudal fin into the water and vibrating it very quickly  in contrast to diving birds in which these forces are produced by the same locomotor module used for propulsion  Of the 64 extant species of flying fish  only two distinct body plans exist  each of which optimizes two different behaviors          7                  8                                        Flying fish   are able to achieve sufficient lift to glide above the surface of the water thanks to their enlarged pectoral fins              Tradeoffs       edit            Tail Structure    While most fish have   caudal fins   with evenly sized lobes  i e  homocaudal   flying fish have an enlarged   ventral   lobe  i e  hypocaudal  which facilitates dipping only a portion of the tail back onto the water for additional thrust production and steering          8                Larger mass    Because flying fish are primarily aquatic animals  their body density must be close to that of water for buoyancy stability  This primary requirement for swimming  however  means that flying fish are heavier than other habitual fliers  resulting in higher wing loading and lift to drag ratios for flying fish compared to a comparably sized bird          7          Differences in wing area  wing span  wing loading  and aspect ratio have been used to classify flying fish into two distinct classifications based on these different aerodynamic designs          7                Biplane body plan       edit          In the   biplane   or     Cypselurus       body plan  both the pectoral and pelvic fins are enlarged to provide lift during flight          7          These fish also tend to have  flatter  bodies which increase the total lift producing area thus allowing them to  hang  in the air better than more streamlined shapes          8          As a result of this high lift production  these fish are excellent gliders and are well adapted for maximizing flight distance and duration      Comparatively      Cypselurus     flying fish have lower wing loading and smaller aspect ratios  i e  broader wings  than their     Exocoetus     monoplane counterparts  which contributes to their ability to fly for longer distances than fish with this alternative body plan  Flying fish with the biplane design take advantage of their high lift production abilities when launching from the water by utilizing a    taxiing glide    in which the hypocaudal lobe remains in the water to generate thrust even after the trunk clears the water s surface and the wings are opened with a small angle of attack for lift generation          7                                      In the   monoplane body plan    only the pectoral fins are abnormally large  In this illustration  note that the pelvic fins are not abnormally large              Monoplane body plan       edit          In the     Exocoetus     or   monoplane   body plan  only the pectoral fins are enlarged to provide lift  Fish with this body plan tend to have a more streamlined body  higher   aspect ratios    long  narrow wings   and higher wing loading than fish with the biplane body plan  making these fish well adapted for higher flying speeds  Flying fish with a monoplane body plan demonstrate different launching behaviors from their biplane counterparts  Instead of extending their duration of thrust production  monoplane fish launch from the water at high speeds at a large angle of attack  sometimes up to 45 degrees           7          In this way  monoplane fish are taking advantage of their adaptation for high flight speed  while fish with biplane designs exploit their lift production abilities during takeoff
