PARENTS 
“Parents”. I consider mine as my flat mates these days because we do not spend much time together. We are four people living in a house together but we even eat our dinners separately because everybody comes home at different times and we are busy all the time. What I remember from the old days is my two grown up flat mates are two different characters so I have no idea why they still live together.

They are pretty much the same in physical appearance.  They both have fair complexions which is typical of Caucasians. They should be thin if we consider this “type” but they are not. Actually they were but I can’t remember those days.

 They have different personalities. My father is moody and pretty much aggressive just like me. He has obsessions, like everything should be perfect. On the other hand, my mother never cares about what she is doing and she has what we will call the patience of a saint. Whenever my father gets angry and starts shouting, my mother goes “Ergun, why are you shouting?” with a very calm voice.

 What they really can’t get along about is their tastes in life. My mother loves spending money. She can spend her whole day going around the stores shopping while my father is sitting at home reading newspapers and books or watching documentaries on TV.

 Although my parents are very different from each other, they came to an agreement and that is not being a parent for me any more. They never worry about me when I am late and they never interfere in my choices. I think from now on they will work on my brother, my poor little brother.
