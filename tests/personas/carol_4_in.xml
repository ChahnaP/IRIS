    There are many ways for people to be happy. Some people are happy maintaining successful business affairs, some of them are happy having big amounts of money and many of them are happy bringing up their children. In my opinion, children are the ultimate bliss in our lives and if I reach the suitable age for marriage; I really want to have at least two children. Not only me but also many people plan to have children of their own   as they    add beauty to our lives.
     
    To begin with, children bring happiness and meaning to your life. Your child belongs to you, and you belong to    him. You know he is a piece of you. If you are a mother, you can easily consider how important it is to see a part of you alive, especially after carrying him for nine months inside you. Watching them, we naturally become happy and begin   to laugh with them with a great love. They are the most beautiful, the best and the most meaningful part of life for us.
     
    Then, we can say that they are our insurance for our old age. It is commonplace to see many old people without children living lonely or unhappy lives in poverty. Those people are the people who have not chosen     to have children or those who have always wanted but not had the chance to have them. There are many famous people like that such as Emel Sayin and our prime minister and his wife, Rahsan and Bulent Ecevit.  We notice that they are very lonely and unhappy now without any children. When we have children, we do not get anxious about our life to continue and our belongings to get wasted. We know that our generation will continue too, by means of our children.
     
    To sum up, many people   are happy to have children and many of them are going to be happy to have them as children not only bring happiness and meaning to our lives and are our insurance but they also help   our generation to continue. They mean so much for us as well since they are worth everything in life.
