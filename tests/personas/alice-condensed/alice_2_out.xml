				<block>edit in some long slender fish eels for example there is little increase in the amplitude of the flexion wave as it passes along the body sub carangiform locomotion edit here there is a more marked increase in wave amplitude along the body with the vast majority of the work being done by the rear half of the fish in general the fish body is stiffer making for higher speed but reduced maneuverability trout use sub carangiform locomotion carangiform locomotion edit fish in this group are stiffer and faster moving than the previous groups the vast majority of movement is concentrated in the very rear of the body and tail carangiform swimmers generally have rapidly oscillating tails thunniform locomotion edit the next to last group is reserved for the high speed long distance swimmers like tuna new research shows that</block>
