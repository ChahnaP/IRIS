This ranking is based on our analysis of  15     published reviews and test drives of the Ford Fusion  and our analysis of reliability and safety data.                       Test drivers nbsp say that stand out looks  lively handling and a roomy interior make the redesigned 2013 Fusion a great choice in its class.            Like other   affordable midsize cars    the 2013 Ford Fusion no longer offers a six cylinder engine. Instead  the Fusion offers three four cylinder engines with a range of horsepower and fuel economy ratings. The base engine comes with an automatic transmission  the mid level engine offers either a manual or automatic and the top engine is mated to an automatic and offers optional all wheel drive. The mid level 1.6 liter EcoBoost with the automatic is expected to be the high volume model  and it gets 23 36 mpg city highway  which is good for the class. Most auto critics drove the mid  and top level EcoBoost engines  saying they deliver strong acceleration.   Left Lane News   writes   Ford s 1.6 and 2.0 liter EcoBoost engines were perfectly suited along Mulholland Highway and Topanga Canyon Roads  where grades of 8 percent were the norm. We never felt underpowered in either when climbing hills or passing slower traffic.  nbsp Reviewers consider the Fusion one of the sportier handlers in the class  and they like the added traction the available all wheel drive provides. The Fusion also has one of the highest reliability ratings in its class.     The Ford Fusion is the 2013   Best Midsize Car for the Money   because it has the best combination of ownership costs and positive reviews in its class. nbsp   The Fusion is also the 2013 nbsp     Best Midsize Car for Families   nbsp   because it has the best combination of quality  size and family friendly features in its class.       Inside  reviewers think the 2013 Fusion is spacious and comfortable. Several are impressed with the depth of the trunk  but a few wish it was wider. The Fusion rsquo s upscale materials are well liked by auto critics  but some think the design and color palette are bland. The Fusion gets dinged for its infotainment systems  Sync with MyFord and MyFord Touch. Complaints include too many buttons  buttons that are too small  counterintuitive navigation directions and confusing menus. Standard features on the 2013 Fusion include voice activated Sync with MyFord  an auxiliary audio jack  post crash alert and MyKey. The Fusion can be equipped with features like navigation  satellite and HD radio  Sync with MyFord Touch  push button start  dual zone automatic climate control  active park assist  a rearview camera  back up sensors and rain sensing wipers. The Fusion also offers several high tech safety features  like blind spot monitoring  a lane keeping alert system  adaptive cruise control and forward collision warning. nbsp          Instead of just pushing the bar up in anticipation of the competition s next move  it has completely side stepped the pack with a five passenger sedan that is both really exciting to look at and genuinely fun to drive. The all new 2013 Fusion possesses authentic European dynamics  class leading technological innovation and mold breaking stylish flair.       Autoblog        Good looks  performance and quality make the Fusion more of a contender than ever  although a fully loaded Titanium model can come with a rather cheeky price tag. Stick with a modestly optioned Fusion SE and you ll find what we figure is the sweet spot of this awfully impressive lineup. If this isn t 2013 s most improved new car  we re not sure what is.       Left Lane News        With solid power  more refinement and top fuel economy  the 2013 Fusion could take Ford to the top of the midsize sedan class.       Edmunds        When you combine the beautiful appearance  smart interior and engaging driving experience with the fuel efficiency and practicality Ford s achieved  the Fusion stands tall as the best car in class. No doubt it is a winner and one that will receive universal praise.  hellip  Simply put  if you are in the market for a midsize sedan and you don t buy the Fusion  you are an idiot. And I judge you. I judge you harshly.

Unlike the Fusion  the Altima offers a 270 horsepower V6  which is more than what the most powerful EcoBoost in the Fusion makes. The Fusion stands out with optional all wheel drive  which is not available on the Altima  but if fuel economy is a top concern  the Altima is the better choice.     Like the Altima and Fusion  the   Honda Accord   is all new for 2013. Reviewers like its extensive powertrain lineup and high quality  spacious cabin  though they don rsquo t think it rsquo s as fun to drive as the Fusion. Similar to the Altima  the Accord has a powerful V6 engine option  but no all wheel drive option.         Compare the Fusion  Altima and Accord  raquo          Details  2013 Ford Fusion     The 2013 Fusion is fully redesigned and available in three trims  S  SE and Titanium. The   Fusion Hybrid   nbsp and   Fusion Energi     plug in hybrid nbsp   are reviewed separately. The Fusion offers three four cylinder engines  two of which are Ford rsquo s EcoBoost engines. All wheel drive is available on the Titanium model.

The Ford Fusion Hybrid is the 2013   Best Hybrid Car for the Money   because it has the best combination of ownership costs and positive reviews in its class. nbsp   The Fusion Hybrid is also the 2013 nbsp     Best Hybrid Car for Families   nbsp   because it has the best combination of quality  size and family friendly features in its class.       The 2013 Fusion Hybrid rsquo s redesigned cabin receives high marks for its roomy  comfortable seats and useful trunk that expands cargo space with a folding rear seat and pass through. Some reviewers think the interior design is attractive and upscale  while others think it rsquo s boring and has some low quality materials. The available MyFord Touch infotainment system continues to irritate auto critics  who think it is difficult to use and confusing.

Considering its impressive economy  beautiful exterior  sweet and easygoing personality  and reasonable  27 995 starting price  the 2013 Fusion hybrid is likely to be popular. However  it looks pretty much like any other Fusion from the outside  so if you re looking for a hybrid that shouts its environmental virtue to the world  get a Prius.       Car and Driver        Sure  it was a bit softer than we might have liked  but we re glad to report that Ford hasn t let lofty fuel economy goals completely suck the life out of the Fusion. It s about as sporty as a hybrid sedan gets for  30K both in how it looks and how it feels from behind the wheel. Add in its impressive fuel economy numbers and this Fusion is a legitimate alternative to the standard Fusion as much as it is a better  more fun to drive competitor to the Prius.

Critics also like the Sonata Hybrid rsquo s upscale cabin and stylish exterior.     The   Toyota Camry Hybrid   delivers better fuel economy than the Sonata Hybrid  but less than the Fusion Hybrid. Though many test drivers think the Camry Hybrid rsquo s transition from gas to electric power is seamless  some note that the engine is noisy under hard acceleration. The Camry Hybrid rsquo s rear seat doesn rsquo t fold like the Fusion Hybrid rsquo s does  but since the battery pack is located in the front of the car  the Camry Hybrid offers more cargo space.

This ranking is based on our analysis of  60     published reviews and test drives of the Mazda Mazda3  and our analysis of reliability and safety data.                        The 2013 Mazda Mazda3 is ranked                         1   in   Affordable Small Cars                          1   in   Affordable Compact Cars                          1   in   Hatchbacks                                      The 2013 Mazda3 ranks highly for its nbsp powerful engines and sharp handling  which test drivers like.            One thing that separates the Mazda3 from its classmates is its nimble  accurate handling  which makes it one of the most fun to drive models in the class. All models have a four cylinder engine. The base model nbsp produces 148 horsepower and the most powerful model  the Mazdaspeed3  has 263 horsepower. Regardless of which engine you choose  test drivers say that most shoppers will be very pleased with the Mazda3 rsquo s performance. The only downside to the Mazda3  auto writers say  is that fuel economy from all but one engine isn rsquo t very good. The 155 horsepower Skyactiv engine  which was new for the 2012 model year  achieves an   EPA   estimated 28 40 mpg city highway  which is great for a small car. Plus  it doesn rsquo t sacrifice performance for efficiency. All models except the Mazdaspeed3  which only comes with a six speed manual transmission  offer a manual and automatic transmission. Depending on the trim  these transmissions have five or six gears. Test drivers think both the manual and automatic transmissions are responsive  but some find that the manuals make the Mazda3 feel faster.     While the 2013 Mazda3 rsquo s performance receives a glowing review from the automotive press  overall evaluations of its interior aren rsquo t as positive. Many auto writers say that the Mazda3 rsquo s second row seats feel tight for the class. Some test drivers even say the front seats won rsquo t offer enough room for tall adults. The Mazda3 is available in sedan and   hatchback   body styles  and several auto writers complain that the sedan doesn rsquo t have much cargo space  though hatchback models have a lot. While no test driver says that the Mazda3 rsquo s interior is cheap  reviewers think the quality of its plastics are below its main rivals like the   Volkswagen Golf  . Reviewers think most of the Mazda3 rsquo s interior controls are straightforward  but some take issue with the Mazda3 rsquo s optional navigation system. They say its small screen  awkward placement in the dashboard and complicated  steering wheel mounted controls make it a pain to use.         Available as a 4 door sedan or 5 door hatchback  the Mazda3 stands out for its fun to drive nature  value and fuel economy.       Kelley Blue Book        It s little wonder why the Mazda 3 is the brand s best selling car. It boasts a stable ride  solid cabin appointments  a versatile hatchback body style  and a fun to drive character unmatched by most like priced rivals of any size.       Consumer Guide        The Mazda 3 has traditionally been considered somewhat of a connoisseurs  choice among compact sedans. With its agile handling  responsive engines and generous features list  the 3 is the compact car that we editors at Edmunds.com not only most frequently recommend to others  but also have  in some cases  purchased for our families.

The Focus also has more interior tech than the Mazda3.  nbsp The Focus can come equipped with one of two infotainment systems  as well as a safety feature called MyKey that helps parents set limits on new drivers. Both the Focus sedan and hatchback have more cargo space than the Mazda3.     If you want more passenger and cargo space  consider the   Chevrolet Cruze   sedan. It has significantly more trunk space than the Mazda3 sedan  and reviewers say both its front and rear seats are comfortable. Though the Cruze isn rsquo t as fast or agile as the Mazda3  its fuel economy ratings are very good. Depending on the model you select  you can get up to 42 mpg on the highway  which is better than the Mazda3 rsquo s ratings.

This ranking is based on our analysis of  46     published reviews and test drives of the Honda Fit  and our analysis of reliability and safety data.                        The 2013 Honda Fit is ranked                         3   in   Affordable Small Cars                          1   in   Affordable Subcompact Cars                          4   in   Hatchbacks                                      The 2013 Honda Fit offers ample passenger and cargo space for such a small car  but nbsp test drivers nbsp wish it had a more powerful engine  more optional features and a quieter cabin. An above average reliability score helps the Fit secure a spot at the top of its class.            While the Honda Fit hatchback rsquo s four cylinder engine isn rsquo t powerful  nbsp critics still say the Fit is pretty fun to drive for a subcompact  thanks to its standard manual transmission and nimble handling. With the automatic transmission  the Fit averages up to 28 35 mpg city highway. Although those ratings aren rsquo t the highest in the class  they rsquo re still good for a hatchback with as much cargo space as the Fit. Still  some nbsp reviewers mention that competitors have quieter interiors  better brakes  higher fuel economy ratings and more powerful engines. Some car reviewers may think that the 2013 Fit falters for its performance  but the Fit trumps many of its better performing competitors  like the   Volkswagen Golf   and   Mazda2    with above average reliability.     The 2013 Honda Fit is the 2013   Best Subcompact Car for the Money   nbsp and the   Best Hatchback for the Money   because it has the best combination of ownership costs and positive reviews those classes.     Despite these criticisms  reviewers note that no competitor can match the Honda Fit rsquo s interior space. The five seat cabin offers front and rear seats with plenty of space for adults  cargo space that rivals some   affordable compact SUVs   and a class exclusive Magic Seat that allows you to arrange the passenger seats to accommodate cargo like a tall plant or bicycle. The Honda Fit has a standard USB port and optional Bluetooth and navigation  which are typical features for the class  but some rivals offer these as well as infotainment systems and optional safety equipment like blind spot monitoring.         Well  its many new competitors outdo the Fit in a number of different ways. The Chevrolet Sonic  Ford Fiesta  Hyundai Accent and Kia Rio offer a more comfortable ride on the road  stronger brakes  more efficient and or powerful engines  and quieter  higher quality interiors.       Edmunds        Ride  acceleration and handling  The new Fit gets top marks in all three categories. It is one of the most enjoyable small cars on the road.       The Washington Post    2009       This is a subcompact in name and exterior size only  it s really a small wagon that challenges some compact SUVs for room while getting significantly better fuel economy. Fit deserves a top spot on your shopping list  but our nod goes to the cheaper  yet no less versatile  Base model.

Focus can come equipped with one of two infotainment systems  as well as a safety feature called MyKey that helps parents set limits on new drivers. Though the Focus doesn rsquo t have as much cargo space as the Fit  it has good fuel economy ratings  an optional turbocharged engine and sedan and hatchback body styles.     If you want a hatchback with outstanding performance for the class  consider the   Mazda3  . Reviewers are impressed with its powerful engines and responsive steering  even on the base model. Keep in mind  though  that test drivers say the Mazda3 rsquo s second row seats are cramped  and it doesn rsquo t have as much cargo space as the Honda Fit.

Although the 2013 Acura TL has polarizing exterior styling  test drivers say that its balanced performance and spacious  high quality interior prove that you can rsquo t judge a book by its cover.            The 2013 Acura TL comes with a choice of two powertrains  and nbsp test drivers nbsp agree that regardless of which engine you choose  the TL provides plenty of power. A responsive six speed automatic is standard  and most nbsp critics nbsp say that it rsquo s well matched to the 2013 TL rsquo s V6. All wheel drive and a larger  more powerful V6 come on the SH AWD trim  which is available with a six speed manual. The TL gets an EPA estimated 20 29 mpg city highway  which is lower than the most fuel efficient cars in the class. However  the Acura TL is also nbsp stronger than fuel efficient rivals like the   Audi A4  . The TL rsquo s suspension isn rsquo t comfort tuned like the   Lexus ES 350    but it rsquo s also not as agile as rivals like the   BMW 3 Series  . As a result  most reviewers agree that the TL strikes a nice balance between sporty handling and a comfortable ride. A stellar reliability rating also enhances the 2013 TL s appeal.     The Acura TL is the   2013 Best Upscale Midsize Car for Families   nbsp because it has the best combination of quality  size and family friendly features in its class.     While the TL may look like a bit of an ugly duckling  test drivers are impressed with its comfortable  spacious seats  numerous tech features and high quality interior materials. The TL offers more standard equipment than a number of cars in the class  including leather upholstery  heated front seats and Bluetooth and USB connectivity. A handful of reviewers say that the TL rsquo s optional navigation system isn rsquo t the easiest to use  and that the TL could use more trunk space  but most auto writers say that if you rsquo re shopping for a well rounded upscale midsize car  the 2013 Acura TL is certainly worth considering.         TL is an excellent choice for its balanced performance  inviting interior  and lots of high tech features at reasonable for the class prices. The smooth new 6 speed automatic transmission  and the higher fuel economy estimates that are part of the deal  is a welcome improvement as well.       Consumer Guide        Acura has fallen off a lot of radar screens over the past decade with its questionable styling and invisible marketing. That s unfortunate  because the TL is a fine car at a competitive price point.       AutoWeek    2012  nbsp       Those looking for a refined ride  a spacious cabin and a full helping of the latest bells and whistles will be well served by the base model TL  a strong competitor to the likes of the Buick LaCrosse  Hyundai Genesis and Lexus ES 350.       Edmunds    2012  nbsp       The 2012 Acura TL marries the size of a BMW 5 Series with the lower price of an Infiniti G37 Sedan  but doesn t capture the performance feel of either.       Kelley Blue Book    2012  nbsp                                                See More Photos  raquo          Other Cars to Consider     If you like the TL rsquo s plethora of standard features  but want a car that rsquo s even more fun to drive  consider the   Infiniti G37  . While the TL has more passenger space  reviewers say the G37 rsquo s interior materials are just as nice  and that its infotainment system is straightforward and easy to use.     The   Buick Regal   isn rsquo t as spacious as the TL  and it rsquo s also not as powerful  but the base Regal offers a comparable list of standard features and better fuel economy at a significantly lower price. If you rsquo re put off by the base Regal rsquo s tepid acceleration  test drivers say that the more powerful Turbo and GS models rectify the issue with their responsive turbocharged engines.         Compare the TL  G37 and Regal  raquo          Details  2013 Acura TL     The 2013 Acura TL seats five and comes with front wheel drive. A 3.5 liter V6 engine and six speed automatic transmission are standard on the base TL. Two trims are offered  base and SH AWD. The TL SH AWD gains a more powerful engine and standard all wheel drive  as well as an available six speed manual transmission. For 2013  the Acura TL sees no major changes.

This ranking is based on our analysis of  18     published reviews and test drives of the Hyundai Sonata  and our analysis of reliability and safety data.                       The 2013 Hyundai Sonata remains competitive in its class  thanks to high fuel economy estimates  modern styling and a spacious cabin. However  a nbsp number of newly redesigned midsize cars may give the Sonata a run for its money.            Though the 2013 Hyundai Sonata is missing a few things that some of its rivals offer  like a six cylinder engine and manual transmission  auto nbsp reviewers aren rsquo t complaining. The 2013 Sonata has a four  and turbo four cylinder engine  and test drivers say both engines offer plenty of power for most drivers. Both engines have good fuel economy ratings of 24 35  base  and 22 34  turbo  mpg city highway for the class. A few auto nbsp writers note that the Sonata rsquo s engines are loud when pushed  but not any more than rivals.     Some nbsp journalists are disappointed with a few mid grade interior materials  but overall  they like the layout  design and functionality the Sonata rsquo s cabin provides. There rsquo s plenty of space for families  and many test drivers like the stylish  contemporary interior design. Reviewers say the 2013 Hyundai Sonata has a good array of standard interior features for the class  including Bluetooth  auxiliary and USB audio jacks  satellite radio and Hyundai rsquo s Blue Link telematics system. The 2013 Sonata can be equipped with features like a rearview camera  heated front and rear seats  a panoramic sunroof  Infinity sound system  HD Radio and navigation. nbsp          If you re in the market for a mid size sedan and the usual suspects fail to arouse your emotions  the 2013 Hyundai Sonata could be the perfect choice. Given its generous level of standard equipment  its lengthy warranty and rising residual values  the Sonata offers perhaps the best value of the group.       Kelley Blue Book        While its suspension composure lags rivals  it is offset by the entire lineup s unique blend of style  interior comfort  standard and available features  and value pricing. That s what makes Sonata an exceptional midsize sedan.       Consumer Guide        This is  quite frankly  a tremendous amount of car for the money.       Edmunds    2011       It gives buyers a huge amount of refinement  driving enjoyment  comfort and style for not a lot of money.

Like the Sonata  it has a spacious cabin and trunk and its interior is filled with upscale materials. While test drivers say the Sonata rsquo s handling is a middle ground between comfort and sport  the Fusion rsquo s handling is described as crisp and athletic. The Fusion offers a manual transmission  which isn rsquo t available on the Sonata  as well as optional all wheel drive on 2.0L Ecoboost models.     The   2013 Chevrolet Malibu   is also worth a look if you rsquo re considering the 2013 Sonata. The Malibu was redesigned for 2013  and reviewers like its modern exterior design  new engines  bountiful tech features and quality cabin materials. Like the Sonata  the 2013 Malibu has nixed the V6 engine option in favor of more fuel efficient four cylinder engines. However  the 2013 Malibu rsquo s optional turbocharged four cylinder engine produces less horsepower than the 2013 Sonata rsquo s optional turbo four.         Compare the Sonata  Fusion and Malibu  raquo             Details  2013 Hyundai Sonata       The 2013 Hyundai Sonata is available in three trims levels  GLS  SE and Limited. The   Hyundai Sonata Hybrid   is reviewed separately. For 2013  Hyundai is no longer offering a manual transmission on any trim level. Heated front seats are now available on all models. A panoramic moonroof that was standard on Limited models is now optional as part of the premium package  and was replaced by a traditional power moonroof. The Hyundai Sonata was last redesigned in 2011. Since it hasn rsquo t changed much since then  this overview uses applicable research and reviews from 2011  2012 and 2013.

This ranking is based on our analysis of  76     published reviews and test drives of the Mazda MX 5 Miata  and our analysis of reliability and safety data.                        The 2013 Mazda MX 5 Miata is ranked                         2   in   Affordable Sports Cars                          1   in   Affordable Convertibles                                      Test drivers nbsp say the 2013 Mazda MX 5 Miata proves that sports cars don rsquo t need to carry high price tags or pack monstrous engines to deliver spirited performance.            The 2013 Mazda MX 5 Miata nbsp has a four cylinder engine  which isn rsquo t as powerful as the engines of many sports cars in the class. However  nbsp test drivers nbsp agree that  combined with the Miata rsquo s light weight  the responsive engine delivers enough power to keep up with newer nbsp competitors like the   Subaru BRZ  . A five speed manual transmission is standard  and test drivers love its short throws. Most also note that the transmission offers precise shifts that reinforce the Mazda Miata rsquo s fun driving dynamics. According to the EPA  the 2013 Miata gets up to 22 28 mpg city highway  which is better than competitors like the   Ford Mustang    but not quite as good as the   Mini Cooper Roadster  . In general  the automotive press loves the Miata rsquo s quick  accurate steering and athletic handling. In a comparison test  one reviewer also notes that the Miata soaks up bumps and road imperfections better than the BRZ. From a practical standpoint  the Miata also earns a better reliability rating than most cars in the class.     Inside  the Miata earns reviewer praise for its attractively designed interior  which features a functional  driver focused control layout. Most interior materials are hard plastic  but auto writers say that they rsquo re attractive and seem appropriate for the Miata rsquo s price. Some test drivers comment that the two seat Miata rsquo s small size means that taller occupants may want more space. The Miata rsquo s trunk is also one of the smallest in the class  but some critics say that if you pack carefully  there rsquo s room for a weekend rsquo s worth of luggage. A few reviewers write that wind and road noise are common on the highway  even with the available hardtop. A six speaker stereo with an auxiliary input jack is standard in the 2013 MX 5 Miata. Options and features available on higher trims include automatic climate control  leather seats  heated seats  Bluetooth  push button start  satellite radio and a Bose stereo.         This is the point at which I input the standard laudatory comments about the MX 5 s excellent handling  outstanding fun to drive factor  and fantastic value. And it s all true  very  very true. I m still convinced this is one of the best driver s cars on today s market.       Consumer Guide   nbsp       The Miata isn t flashy or fast. It s just a fun  affordable and reliable roadster that is guaranteed to bring a smile to the face of anyone with a beating heart and a valid driver s license.       Kelley Blue Book        The Mazda comes to this battle at an apparent disadvantage  It s wearing the same armor it has had since this Miata generation debuted way back in 2005  while the Subaru  BRZ  has an all new chassis with the latest tech. Yet around town  the Miata is an absolute pleasure.       Popular Mechanics   nbsp  2012       This compact convertible offers everything a driver needs  style  convenience and ample fun.

This ranking is based on our analysis of  20     published reviews and test drives of the Chrysler 300  and our analysis of reliability and safety data.                       With composed handling  powerful engine choices and a luxurious  well equipped interior  nbsp test drivers nbsp agree that the 2013 Chrysler 300 is among the most refined affordable large cars.            The 2013 Chrysler 300 is available with a choice of three engines  and reviewers agree that even the base V6 offers a satisfying amount of power. An eight speed automatic transmission is standard  which test drivers say is smooth  refined and helps the 300 return fuel economy of 19 31 mpg city highway. A Hemi V8 engine and a five speed automatic transmission are optional on the 300  while high performance 300 SRT8 models are even nbsp more powerful. Despite its size  most nbsp test drivers nbsp say that the 300 provides a comfortable ride and composed  confident handling  which makes it one of the more enjoyable cars to drive in the class.     Test drivers praise the 2013 Chrysler 300 for its comfortable  luxurious interior  which is built with premium materials for the class. Most reviewers also appreciate the cabin for its spaciousness  though a few critics say that the back seat could offer more head  and legroom. Aside from the   Hyundai Azera    the 2013 300 also comes with more standard features than most cars in the class. The 300 rsquo s standard equipment includes leather seats  heated front seats  push button start  dual zone automatic climate control and Chrysler rsquo s Uconnect infotainment system  which includes Bluetooth phone and audio streaming and a USB port. Reviewers love Uconnect for its large touch screen display and user friendly operation. They also note that the 300 rsquo s Garmin based navigation system is one of the most intuitive systems on the market. Additional options and features on higher trims include a backup camera  front and rear parking sensors  an upgraded stereo and a blind spot monitoring system.         Rear seat room is a sore spot  and we have a few niggling issues with the climate audio control interface. Still  the 300 is a classy large sedan that delivers a refined driving experience.       Consumer Guide   nbsp       Chrysler s 300 sedan for 2013 certainly offers a plethora of tech based features worth highlighting  but the most memorable first impression is the remarkably quiet cabin and supple ride.       Kelley Blue Book   nbsp       I basically like everything about this 2012 Chrysler 300C. I could probably find some nits to pick  but at the moment  I m digging the power  the way the engine sounds like a hot rod  the ride handling mix  interior quality and roominess pretty much all of it.       AutoWeek    2012  nbsp       It s not that I wouldn t want the 300S as my very own  but it has such a masculine vibe that it perfectly suits stylish men with families. These stylish men  however  must be willing to share with their spouses  it s the mack daddy car that mack mommies also will enjoy.

Like the 300  the LaCrosse eAssist comes with a long list of standard features  and reviewers love its luxurious interior.     The   Ford Taurus   doesn rsquo t come with as many standard features  but it does provide composed handling and a powerful base engine at a lower price. While the Taurus also has a larger trunk than the 300  some reviewers say that its back seat could be more spacious.         Compare the 300  LaCrosse and Taurus  raquo          Details  2013 Chrysler 300     The 2013 Chrysler 300 seats five and has standard rear wheel drive. A 3.6 liter V6 engine and eight speed automatic transmission are standard  while a 5.7 liter V8 engine and five speed automatic are available on higher trims. The 300 comes in five trim levels  300  base   300S  300C  300 C Luxury Series and the high performance 300 SRT8  which comes with a more powerful 6.4 liter V8 engine. All wheel drive is optional on all but the SRT8 trim. The Chrysler 300 gains standard leather seats and heated front seats for 2013  but sees few other changes. As a result  this overview uses applicable research and reviews from 2011 and 2012  as well as the current model year.

The Toyota Prius is a fine midsize car that just happens to achieve some of the best fuel economy we ve ever experienced. There are some compromises  namely in terms of acceleration  rear visibility  and a somewhat cheap looking interior. In the grand scheme  these are fairly minor niggles given the car s decent ride  accommodating cabin  and exceptional cargo versatility.       Consumer Guide        We rsquo ve never gotten too excited about the Toyota Prius around here. On one hand  as an extreme fuel sipper with a distinctive design and contrarian appeal  the Prius is laudable in the manner with which it eschews traditional luxury and conspicuous speed in favor of high tech eco features  utter thrift  and unconventional hatchback living. On the other hand  with skinny tires  a loud cabin  terrible rear vision  and a boomy ride  the Prius has been the exact opposite of fun to drive.
